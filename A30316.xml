         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>THE Epi≈øtle Dedicatory.</hi> To the Right Honourable, Learned and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Sir <hi>Thomas Burnet</hi> of <hi>Leis,</hi> Knight and Baronett, and one of their Maje≈øties mo≈øt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council; for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Grace, Peace, and all Happine≈øs, both Temporal and Eternal.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the Promi≈øe of the All-Glorious God, to Honour tho≈øe that Honour him; there be four ≈øpecial ways, whereby God Honours Men.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, When he rai≈øeth them out of nothing, wor≈øe than nothing, yea, from the very depth of Hell, to a height of Heavenly Honour, Happine≈øs and Holine≈øs in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes them more Excellent than their Neighbours, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. more Excellent, not in degrees only, but in kind; more Excellent in their Birth, for they are Born again of the Word, and of the Spirit; more Excellent in their Thoughts, more Excellent in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, more Excellent in their Practices, more Excellent in their Lives, in Regard of Gods Favour towards them; and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:65284:3"/> in their Death, their Death is ≈øweet to them: All True Chri≈øtians are truly Right Honourable, and Truly Royal: They are Loyal Subjects, and a Royal Prie≈øt-hood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. They are really the lowe≈øt, yet the highe≈øt People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. Lowe≈øt in their own Sen≈øe, highe≈øt in Gods ≈øight, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and 5.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God Honours Men, when he gives them Hearts to ≈øerve him, in a Faithful and Fruitful Subjection to his Will. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is not only Duty, but al≈øo our Priviledge and Preferment. Hence <hi>Theodo≈øius</hi> Gloryed more in that he was a Servant of Chri≈øt, than being Emperour of the <hi>Ea≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God Honours Men, when he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes Men to places of Eminency above others: And makes them Faithful, in employing their power for God, and Piou≈øly prudent in their publick Deportment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But the highe≈øt Honour ≈øhall be hereafter in Heaven, when the Saints ≈øhall be filled brim full, with Grace and Glory. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Honour God, until he hath Honoured us: We cannot give glory to God, until we have received glory from him; becau≈øe he fir≈øt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours us; Grace is Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> God hath Honoured your Family, with the True≈øt Honour in Chri≈øt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Your Ance≈øtors have been Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:3"/> for Piety, Virtue, Religion and Zeal to Gods Glory; and God hath made you a Honourable Branch, of that Honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and hath given you a Heart to Honour him again. Some Families are valued from Antiquity, who can pretend Title to Religion or Virtue in them≈øelves or Ance≈øtors; but your Honour is truly valuable on both accounts, and indeed from Religion, and Exemplary practice of Godline≈øs, the Ble≈ø≈øing on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Per≈øons, is to be expected. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs and Debauchery, hath lain ≈øo long on ≈øome Families, as a Moth, until they are altogether gangren'd; and as the Degeneracy of ≈øome Families in Religion and Morals, is too, too palpable, it's to be likewi≈øe feared, their Extirpation may be as Con≈øpicuous, and it ought to be Matter of Humiliation, that Impiety hath been ≈øo Predominant, without Parallel, in the late Reigns; From the inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øable Incouragement at the Helm; that the mo≈øt Con≈øiderable Families in the≈øe Nations, have been Sullyed with the blacke≈øt Stains of Vice, ≈øo that Morality hath been accounted pedantry, and Religion Bafouned and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed. And it mu≈øt be allowed the Glory, as well as the Mercy of ≈øome, who have not been carryed away in ≈øuch a Deluge. And your Honour by the ≈øpecial Conduct of Providence, hath been pre≈øerved in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:4"/> as an Exemplary Stock to graft upon, for the future Propagation of Religion.</p>
            <p>The≈øe following Sheets, being a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the private Meditations of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Born and Educated in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> near to your Honours Antient Mannor of <hi>Crathis;</hi> In his Solitude, when by Providence, he was re≈øtrained from the Exerci≈øe of his Talent, in the way of his Profe≈ø≈øion and Education; and only intended for the u≈øe of him≈øelf, and Family. But whil≈øt in his Confinement, he was vi≈øited by ≈øome Chri≈øtian Friends, as well of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, as Civil Profe≈ø≈øion, and the≈øe Sheets coming occa≈øionally to be by them viewed and approved of; The Author was Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to Print the ≈øame, as containing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars, which might tend to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Religion. But for ≈øeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, he was Aver≈øe; as Fir≈øt, his then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances could not bear the Charge of the Pre≈øs; Secondly, He hath truly ob≈øerved, that the ≈øincere Affections to Religion in Life and Practice, is ≈øo decayed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wrote on that Subject, unle≈øs varni≈øhed under the Name of ≈øome Author Eminently in Vogue, the ≈øame is implicitly vilified; and he intending not to be known, and con≈øidering, if known, his Name might not be Authentick, to give Reputation to
<pb facs="tcp:65284:4"/> the Truth of the Writing, however valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ≈øelf. Thirdly, That as Books are valued not ≈øo much for the matter they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as the Fame of the Author, or Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciny of ≈øome Eminent Per≈øon, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf at a lo≈øs, to whom to Dedicate, fearing in this Degeneracy of zeal for God, his Dedication might be con≈øtrued avarice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than de≈øire of a Patrone.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Sheets lying thus in their Swadling-Cloaths, and like to peri≈øh in Darkne≈øs, and I being Familiarly acquainted with the Author, and finding that in them the mo≈øt Nervous parts of Practical Relegion, were Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciou≈øly Treated and Methodized, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Zeal, in Advancing Religion, to Solicite the Authors Permi≈ø≈øion to Publi≈øh the≈øe Sheets; and the rather, for what was his Di≈øcouragement, in want of Patron, was my Encouragement, that I might Pre≈øume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Honours Favour on this behalf.</p>
            <p>The Author having appo≈øitely Intituled this Treati≈øe <hi>(The Anatomy of Man)</hi> as being a Series of the whole State of Man, from his Creation, to his Eternal Re≈øt in Glory, and I having the Happine≈øs to be ≈øo well acquainted with your Honours zeal, for the Kingdom of Chri≈øt, and of your Knowledge in all the My≈øtical and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts of Religion, your Serene Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:65284:5"/> to di≈øtingui≈øh, and your Charity to Encourage good Intentions, and Indulge E≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, I could no where find a ≈øafer Sanctuary for <hi>(the Anatomy of Man)</hi> than in your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Protection. Neither could I, without the Violation of greate≈øt obligations, omit this Oblation to your Honour; and if I may be ju≈øtified from the fal≈øe Imputation of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, I can boldly aver, your Honour is duly Intituled to ≈øuch Patrociny, not only from the long Series of your Judicious, Ju≈øt, and Honourable Ance≈øtors; but al≈øo from your own Exemplary E≈øpou≈øing, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and Encouraging of Religion; and Con≈øtant, Holy, Affection to the Go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Therefore Right Honourable, through your gentle Hands, I commend this Treati≈øe to the World. It is not nece≈ø≈øary that I ≈øhould give it an account, why I ≈øeek ≈øo far from home! God hath wrought my Heart, to Love tho≈øe that Love him, and Honour tho≈øe that Honour him: And di≈øtance of Place, cannot Abridge my Duty. With all this, I would the World ≈øhould know, I am one, among≈øt tho≈øe many, who truly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you for your Virtues. In Te≈øtimony whereof, I make this Dedication to your Worthy Name, and Honourable Per≈øon, which I be≈øeech you to accept of, as an
<pb facs="tcp:65284:5"/> Acknowledgment of that Debt I owe, and the unfeigned de≈øire I have of your Souls Welfare.</p>
            <p>Let the≈øe Sheets as hopeful Twins, find ≈øhelter under your Wings, and Protection under your Roof. If your Honour approve of them, and find in them the Anatome of the Title, and that they may be of u≈øe to the pre≈øent, and after Generations, your Countenance is implored thereunto as a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre, which in ≈øome mea≈øure, may ≈øupply Omi≈ø≈øions or Defects of the Author. And as he is ≈øond of your Patrociny, and will gratefully acknowledge the Honour of it, I mu≈øt needs own my Renewed Obligations, in the Acceptance of this my Addre≈øs; and ≈øhall by Divine A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, never be wanting, to Wi≈øh and Pray for the Increa≈øe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Grace, Honour, and Pro≈øperity to your ≈øelf, your Pious, Honourable Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and Zealou≈øly Religious Lady, and Hopeful Succe≈ø≈øion, as the indi≈øpen≈øable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of,</p>

            <p>IF we con≈øider Man in his fir≈øt Creation, as Created in the Likene≈øs, and after the Image of God, <hi>Gen. 1.27.</hi> in Righteou≈øne≈øs, True Holine≈øs, and Knowledge, <hi>Eph. 4.24.

            <p>If on the other hand, we con≈øider that pale and di≈ømal Countenance of all things, under that woful Apo≈øtacy, and Spirit of Rebellion, again≈øt God in this our Day, <hi>That every Imagination of the Thoughts of Mans Heart, is only Evil continually,</hi> Gen. <hi>6.5. That Man denyeth God, hath gone a≈øtray from him, is become filthy, that there is none that doth good, no not one, nor any that calleth on God,</hi> P≈ø. <hi>14. to 5.</hi> That Man hath lifted up his Heels, and Revolted from his Maker.

<pb facs="tcp:65284:7"/> 
               <hi>Man was Holine≈øs to the Lord, at his Creation in Gods Image, Jer. 2.3.</hi> but now is a Loath≈øom Batch of all filthine≈øs, <hi>From the Sole of the Foot, even unto the Head, there is no ≈øoundne≈øs in it, we are fall as an unclean thing, and all our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs are as filthy Rags, and we do all fade away as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the Wind have taken us away,</hi> I≈ø. <hi>1.6.</hi> ch. <hi>64.6, 7.</hi>

            <p>As Man hath Revolted in Di≈øobedience from God, ≈øo we find a Revolt, Confu≈øion, and Apo≈øtacy among≈øt the Creatures, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Di≈øobedience is ≈øo broke out among≈øt Men, that through the Pride and Voluptuous Appetite of Mens Hearts, the World is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Degenerated into an a≈ø≈øumed Annarchy, of ≈øelf-intere≈øt, and preferrence, ≈øo that due Subjection is declined, unle≈øs con≈øtrained by force; and that among≈øt Men, fir≈øt, in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>David</hi> was Per≈øecuted, and hunted like a Partridge by <hi>Saul</hi> his Father in Law, and had his Crown u≈øurped from him by his own Son <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolom, 2 Sam. 15.</hi> and <hi>Zenacherib</hi> King of <hi>A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øyria,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, If we look on the World in re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Politick Con≈øtitution, what Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Country, or People ≈øhall we find quiet from Commotions, Di≈øturbances, Rebellions, or Mutinies, either from the Oppre≈ø≈øion, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or U≈øurpation of the Soveraign, or the Murmurings, Jealou≈øies, and Mutinous, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øie, and Di≈øcontented Humours of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? <hi>Doth not</hi> Judah <hi>vex</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and</hi> Ephraim <hi>envy</hi> Judah, I≈ø. <hi>11.13. doth not the Church Complain, Servants have ruled over us, and none delivered out of their Hands, Kings are hanged up by their Hand, the faces of Elders were not Honoured?</hi> Lam. <hi>5.8, 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not the whole World at Enmity, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again≈øt Nation, and Nations divided by inte≈øtine Wars, and Contentions? This Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not only between Man and Man, but hath al≈øo infected the Bea≈øts of the Field,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:8"/> Fi≈øh of the Sea, and fouls of the Air; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in Mans fir≈øt State, he had all of them given him for u≈øe, with Dominion over them; they are turned wild, run into Rebellion, and not to be ≈øubdued or made u≈øeful, but by force, and many are not only u≈øele≈øs, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructive, and they al≈øo are at War among≈øt them≈øelves, de≈øtroying one another; ≈øo that in place of <hi>all the Sons of God, ≈øhouting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for Joy,</hi> as in the fir≈øt State, we now hear the noi≈øe of Wars, Malice, Envy and De≈øtruction; and whereas at fir≈øt, <hi>God looked on all that he had made, and it was very good, Gen. 1.31.</hi> afterwards for the Degeneracy thereof, <hi>It repented God, that he had made Man on the Earth, and it griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at his Heart, Gen. 6.6.</hi> and whereas all things were good when fir≈øt Created, and given to Man for u≈øe; the Scripture tells us, <hi>That the Friend≈øhip of the World is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God, and who≈øoever will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God. If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> Ja. <hi>4.4. 1</hi> Jo. <hi>2.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then the Heavenly Harmony, Union, and joyful Shoutings of the Sons of God, was Ravi≈øhing and Refre≈øhful, even to ≈øitting down under that ≈øhadow with great delight, and being ≈øick of Love, when Man and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was in its fir≈øt Integrity, when we look
<pb facs="tcp:65284:9"/> on the black and defaced Countenance of Man and Creatures, defiled with all manner of Sin and Pollution, and the World with all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Wickedne≈ø≈øes and Contention, and being Branded with Gods di≈øplea≈øure.</p>
            <p>How great rea≈øon have we with the Church to cry out, <hi>How is the Gold become Dim; How is the mo≈øt fine Gold changed? and with</hi> David <hi>to ≈øay, Wo is me, that I So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in</hi> Me≈øech, <hi>and dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar? P≈ø. <hi>120.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Soul of Righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> was grieved at the Iniquity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> how much more Rea≈øon have Men now adays, to grieve for that univer≈øal Deluge of Abominations, which overflow the whole, while earth in ≈øerious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man in his Integrity, and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Creation, and the pre≈øent Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy under Sin and Mi≈øery, and being Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to under≈øtand that My≈øtery, why the World once approved of God to be good, and given to Man, ≈øhould afterwards be ≈øtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gods Cur≈øe and Di≈øplea≈øure, as in the foregoing Scripture, I was entertained with that of <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Shall Mortal Man be more ju≈øt than God, ≈øhall a Man be more pure than his Maker, Job. 4.17.</hi> which lead me to enquire into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cau≈øes of this great Cata≈øtrophe, and to under≈øtand the meaning, together with the
<pb facs="tcp:65284:9"/> Ju≈øtice of God, and the Mi≈øtery of his Love to believers, in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>In this enquiry, I was led up to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gods bounty to Man, by which he was made in the likene≈øs of God in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, true Holine≈øs, and Knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of him that Created him, and had the other Creatures given to him for u≈øe, with Dominion over them, under the Tenure of his Obedience, and under the Commination and A≈ø≈øurance of Death on his Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>I had no ≈øooner viewed the Happine≈øs of his fir≈øt E≈øtate, when I was led to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of his Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, by putting forth his Heart to Rebellion, and his Hands to the Tre≈øpa≈øs, and then found the Judgment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred again≈øt him, by which he was degraded of his Soveraignty, and Enmity was ≈øown between him and the Creatures, and the Earth accur≈øed for his ≈øake, <hi>Gen. 3.14.</hi> to <hi>20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here with the Prophet, we may put the que≈øtion, is Man the Darling of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, made lately in Gods own Image, and Lord of all the Creation? is he now <hi>a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a Home-born Slave? why is he ≈øpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The An≈øwer is in the Text, ha≈øt thou not procured this to thy ≈øelf, In that thou ha≈øt for≈øaken the Lord thy God? for my People have committed two Evils, they have for≈øaken me, the Fountain of Living Waters,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:10"/> and hewed them≈øelves Ci≈øterns, broken Ci≈øterns, that can hold no Water,</hi> Jer. <hi>2.11, 13, 14, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And with the ≈øame Prophet we may cry out with A≈øtoni≈øhment, Be A≈øtoni≈øhed O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and be horribly afraid, be ye very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolate, ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. <hi>2.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is this Riddle re≈øolved, <hi>≈øhall Mortal Man be more Ju≈øt than God? Shall Man be more pure than his Maker,</hi> Man hath for≈øaken God, and followed his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, therefore God mu≈øt be ju≈øt, to bring upon him the Judgment threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> the forfeiture of all his Priviledges, and make him ≈ømart under the folly of his own Devices. <hi>They hatch</hi> Cockatrice <hi>Eggs, and weave the Spiders Webb, he that eateth of their Eggs dyeth, and that which is cru≈øhed breaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Viper, their Webb ≈øhall not become Garments, neither ≈øhall they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with their Works, their Works are Works of Iniquity,</hi> I≈ø. <hi>59.5, 6, 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we find God is Ju≈øt, in puni≈øhing Man for his Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and Man by his Folly hath brought him≈øelf and Po≈øterity to ruin, who through the Pride of his Concupi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, abode not in his Integrity, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining again≈øt God, hath brought him≈øelf and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity, under Servitude to Sin, Mi≈øery, and Death.</p>
            <p>Thus while <hi>with</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Children, and refu≈øing to be Comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:65284:10"/> they were not,</hi> Jer. <hi>31.15.</hi> I was plunged in oppre≈ø≈øion of Thoughts, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lamenting, that ≈øo glorious a Fabrick of Gods Handy-work, as in the fir≈øt Creation, in Holine≈øs and Integrity ≈øhould be polluted by Sin, and defaced from the primitive Beauty, and as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> pleading with God from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his own Glory and Power, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his People of <hi>I≈ørael, Num. 14.11.</hi> to <hi>17.</hi> heartily wi≈øhing, that glorious and fir≈øt Image might again be re≈øtored in Man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of him that Created it, I was led to that Scripture, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ≈øaith the Lord, for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ≈øo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts,</hi> I≈ø. <hi>55.8, 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while mu≈øing what the Spirit meant in the≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions, I was carryed back, to review the fatal Record of mans Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sentence for his Rebellion, in which I found written, <hi>And I will put Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed, and her Seed, it ≈øhall brui≈øe thy Head, and thou ≈øhalt brui≈øe his Heel,</hi> Gen. <hi>3.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being yet more in the dark, as to the meaning of that Scripture, I was led to that of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham, and I will E≈øtabli≈øh my Covenant between thee
<pb facs="tcp:65284:11"/> and me, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations for an everla≈øting Covenant,</hi> Gen. <hi>17.7, 8.</hi> and to that other Word of God to <hi>Mo≈øes, I will rai≈øe them up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet among≈øt their Brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words into his mouth, and he ≈øhall ≈øpeak unto them all the words which I have commanded him,</hi> Deut. <hi>18.18.</hi> And being led a little further, to under≈øtand the meaning of this, I met with that Word of the Lord to <hi>David,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, And thine Hou≈øe, and thy Kingdom ≈øhall be E≈øtabli≈øhed for ever before thee, and thy Throne ≈øhall be E≈øtabli≈øhed for ever, 2</hi> Sam. <hi>7.11, to 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that of <hi>David</hi> him≈øelf, <hi>The Lord hath Sworn in Truth unto</hi> David, <hi>he will not turn from it, of the Fruit of thy Body will I ≈øet upon thy Throne,</hi> P≈ø. <hi>132.11. And the Lord hath ≈øaid to my Lord, ≈øit thou at my Right Hand, until I make thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thy Foot-≈øtool,</hi> P≈ø. <hi>110.1. and that other place of the ≈øame Prophet</hi> David, <hi>And thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuffer thy Holy one to ≈øee Corruption,</hi> P≈ø. <hi>16.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus being led to the view of the≈øe Scriptures, and being yet more Anxious to under≈øtand their meaning, I was at la≈øt, by the Ble≈ø≈øing of God, led to that of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:65284:11"/> of the <hi>Acts, ver≈øe 22,</hi> to <hi>37.</hi> And that of the 7th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> And to the≈øe words, <hi>Of this mans Seed, hath God according to his promi≈øe, rai≈øed unto</hi> I≈ørael <hi>a Saviour,</hi> Acts <hi>13.15, to 42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which I found plainly laid open, that before the Foundations of the Earth were laid, <hi>2 Tim. 1.9.</hi> God according to his own purpo≈øe, had provided the means of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that all the foregoing Scriptures under the Old Te≈øtament, were Prophetical of his Eternal purpo≈øe, and good Will, and that in the fulne≈øs of time, he ≈øhould ≈øend one, even Je≈øus Chri≈øt, to take upon him the Nature of man, with whom God entred into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Covenant, and that for Sin, Sin ≈øhould be Condemned in the fle≈øh, and that Everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Prophets ≈øpoken of by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and E≈øtabli≈øhing of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne for ever, are all meant of that Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant between God and Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> by which Covenant, Chri≈øt was to come in the fle≈øh, and ≈øuffer death as he did, and that he ≈øhould obtain Eternal Life, for all ≈øuch as ≈øhould believe in him, <hi>Jo. 3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus being in≈øtructed, that the manifold promi≈øes and priviledges ≈øpoken of in the Old and New Te≈øtament, do belong to Believers, and that as well Salvation, as Faith, to lay hold on Je≈øus Chri≈øt, are freely of God as a gift,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:12"/> 
               <hi>Jam. 1.17.</hi> Hence I found the Truth of that of Gods Word, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts;</hi> our thoughts are narrow, and run on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the le≈ø≈øer things, and would de ≈øatisfied with the Re≈øtoration of man, to his fir≈øt E≈øtate in the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> and con≈øidering this new and Second Covenant, in the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> not only of things Temporal, but al≈øo of things Eternal, and that this Second Covenant is Everla≈øting, ≈øure, and not ≈øubject to the fatal Apo≈øtacy, as was that in the fir≈øt <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in Contemplation of the Happy State of man, in his Fir≈øt Creation, the Heart was rai≈øed to rejoyce in God, and magnifie his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and could not but take plea≈øure in ≈øo choice a Speculation, and as on reflection upon the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and decayed condition of man, upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, the Soul mu≈øt needs be dejected with melancholy and grievous thoughts, how highly may the Soul be Elevated with Admiration, of that infinite love of God to mankind, in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who hath in him, cho≈øen of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, before the Foundation of the World?</hi> Eph. <hi>1.4, 5. having prede≈øtinated them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Adoption of Children to him≈øelf,</hi> and properly apply that of the Holy Prophet, <hi>Eye hath not ≈øeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man (be≈øides thee O Lord) what good things he hath laid up for them, who wait on him,</hi> I≈ø. <hi>64.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65284:12"/>
            <p>Thus, Chri≈øtian Reader, being led unto the meditation of the≈øe three material Concerns of mans everla≈øting condition, I have Collected the≈øe en≈øuing Sheets, in which I have fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered mans condition in the Fir≈øt Creation, and Secondly under his Apo≈øtacy, wherein I have examined, that original Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ingredients thereof, and how far the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity are guilty, and affected with the Evil Con≈øequences of the ≈øame; upon which are made ≈øome practical Inferences. Thirdly, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered the Covenant of grace in the Second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> wherein I have touched on all the Duties incumbent on Believers under that Covenant, and have met with all the emergent Ca≈øes of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, incident to Believers, in the militant State, ≈øuch as ≈øpiritual de≈øertion, Afflictions by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Impri≈øonment, Poverty, Reproach, lo≈øs of, and being for≈øaken by Friends and Relations, and have collected and applyed the ≈øeveral promi≈øes to the re≈øpective ca≈øes, and in the clo≈øe, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Duty of Chri≈øtian Patience, and Per≈øeverance, with the promi≈øes ≈øuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and la≈øtly, have drawn a large Series of Chri≈øtian Duties, and Truths, in ≈øhort Heads, with the Scriptural Proofs thereof; ≈øo as in two or three Pages, the marrow of the whole is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and as I dare averr in all Chri≈øtian Sincerity, the≈øe Sheets were only Collected for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and Dome≈øtick u≈øe, without any intention
<pb facs="tcp:65284:13"/> of ≈øending them to publick view, by which means they are in a more naked and rude dre≈øs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Curio≈øity of Eloquence or Artificial patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as by the importunity of ≈øome Friends, I was induced to ≈øend them abroad, I ≈øhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øire thus much in Chri≈øtian Charity, that thou maye≈øt believe that the≈øe are the effects of ≈øerious enquiry into the Holy Scriptures, with Meditation and Prayer, and narrowly ≈øearching into Truth, with what ≈øtrength I could obtain by grace; and that neither in O≈øtentation, or for ≈øecular ends they are ≈øent abroad, but in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, if it may be, that others may find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that Light and E≈øtabli≈øhment in the way of God, which I hope I have, and ≈øhall find, and conceiving this to be a Duty, according to that of the Holy Apo≈øtle, <hi>Look not every Man on his own things, but every Man al≈øo on the things of another,</hi> Phil. <hi>2.4. and that thou maye≈øt have the Truths of grace Sealed on thy Soul, and that Chri≈øt may dwell in thy Heart by Faith, and that being Rooted and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love, thou can≈øt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chri≈øt, which pa≈ø≈øeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. <hi>3.17, 18, 19. and that thou may≈øt be filled with all the fulne≈øs of God;</hi> In all ≈øincerity is the earne≈øt Prayer of, thine in Chri≈øt Je≈øus our Lord.</p>

            <head>THE Anatomy of Man.</head>
            <p>SInce Man's Woful Apo≈øtacy from God, Sin is become ≈øo habitual, that the Cu≈øtom hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Con≈øcience of it, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ≈øo conden≈øed in mens hearts, without the due ≈øen≈øe thereof, that unle≈øs upon gro≈øs out-breakings, little remor≈øe is expre≈ø≈øed for Sin, and Guilt for mo≈øt part is only owned from actual Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, and men do not charge them≈øelves with the guilt of Original Sin, as ≈øuppo≈øing that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to them, as coming from <hi>Adam</hi>'s particular Act and Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and take them≈øelves not to be accountable therefore, as being the ≈øingle Act of another; and if any thing of that guilt be owned, it is only by roate, and as coming from education, or the cu≈øtomary profe≈ø≈øion of Religion, without the due ≈øen≈øe or con≈øcience of the guilt; and in regard that Original ≈øin, hath more in it than one ≈øingle act, (though that one act of di≈øobedience was cau≈øe enough of all the mi≈øery that followed) and that the con≈øequence of that di≈øobedience, hath fallen upon, and concerneth all the Po≈øterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> we ≈øhall therefore con≈øider,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, What Original Sin was in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, How far the Po≈øterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are therein concerned, or chargeable and affected with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ≈øhall make ≈øome practical Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and U≈øes from thence.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65284:14"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If we con≈øider <hi>Adam,</hi> the fir≈øt and root of all Mankind, that he was of God created after the Likene≈øs of God, in his Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. and at his fir≈øt Creation had power and command given him to increa≈øe and multiply, and ≈øubdue and have dominion, over the Fi≈øh of the Sea, the Fowls of the Air, and every thing that moveth on the Earth, (under re≈øtriction from eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) with a penalty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eating thereof, that he ≈øhould ≈øurely dye. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. Thus Man made after the Likene≈øs of God, and in the Image of God, let us examine what this Likene≈øs and Image was; The Holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that it was <hi>Righteou≈øne≈øs and true Holine≈øs,</hi> Eph. 4.24.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame Apo≈øtle el≈øewhere informs us, that it was <hi>in Knowledge, after the Image of him that Created him,</hi> Col. 3.10.</p>
            <p>By the≈øe words of Righteou≈øne≈øs, true Holine≈øs, and Knowledge, we may under≈øtand, that <hi>Adam</hi> in his fir≈øt Creation, was endowed with all ≈øuitable faculties of the Mind, to under≈øtand the Nature of all Bea≈øts, Fowls, Fi≈øhes, creeping Things, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatives, how to u≈øe and apply them to his own u≈øe, and govern them in order to their ≈øubjection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and congruity among them≈øelves; as we find by Gods bringing the Creatures to <hi>Adam,</hi> to ve≈øt him with Soveraignty over them, and that he might expre≈øs his faculty of under≈øtanding, by giving to them names, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19, 20. and as ≈øome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali≈øts ob≈øerve, he gave to them names ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant or expre≈ø≈øive of their nature, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Knowledge of their ≈øeveral Natures, from that primitive Knowledge given to him in his fir≈øt Creation.</p>
            <p>By Righteou≈øne≈øs rendred in the Latine Ju≈øtice,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65284:14"/> as it is the Likene≈øs, and Image of God, we mu≈øt under≈øtand all integrity of Mind, leading to what is right, and forbearing what is wrong.</p>
            <p>By true Holine≈øs, we mu≈øt under≈øtand, all purity of Mind, Will and Affections in Sincerity and Truth, to affect only and de≈øire what is ju≈øt, pure, holy, and good, and to ≈øhun all Thoughts, Affections, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Purpo≈øes to the contrary, as <hi>God is of purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by that Knowledge of God, according to the Image of him that created him, we mu≈øt under≈øtand effectual and ≈øufficient knowledge, not only of things natural, but al≈øo of Spiritual Truths, by which man was made effectually capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, and to do good, to ab≈øtain from, and re≈øi≈øt evil.</p>
            <p>Thus Man being compo≈øed, in ≈øuch excellent frame, capable to under≈øtand all things, as well of God him≈øelf, as of the Creatures, and that he had his Being of God, and ≈øufficiently under≈øtood the Terms under which he was confined to his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Obedience to God, and the con≈øequence of his Di≈øobedience, and there being given to him entire Integrity, not tainted by any pollution, or di≈øabled by infirmities, in full po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enjoyments, with the knowledge of the glorious ≈øoveraignty of God, and Maje≈øty in the Creation, ≈øufficient to delight him≈øelf in God, and glorifie his Maker in the Station he had placed him. If <hi>David</hi> after the Apo≈øtacy, when for Sin the World was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and brought under the Cur≈øe and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, did then admire Mans Excellency, Power, and Glory, how much more when in Mans Integrity, unity of the Creation, without Enmity, Jarring, or Di≈øcord, Emulation or Contention? the Morning Stars ≈øang together, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. and all the Sons of God ≈øhouted for Joy. How had the fir≈øt Man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65284:15"/> to cry out; <hi>How excellent art thou Lord in all the Earth? And what is Man; that thou remembre≈øt him, or the Son of Man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi> And what rea≈øon had he? And how much had it been his and the happine≈øs of all Po≈øterities, to have ≈øate down contentedly, in admiration and obedience of God, and in quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all created enjoyments, and ≈øubjection of the Creatures to him?</p>
            <p>Thus Man Created in Righteou≈øne≈øs, true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and Knowledge, after the Image of God, made Lord of all the Creatures, and in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion thereof, having ≈øufficient knowledge to under≈øtand his Duty and Intere≈øt, and to know the advantage of Obedience, and con≈øequence of breach of Duty, breaks the Chain of his Obedience; and eats the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p>Whereupon God in his Ju≈øtice, according to his Promi≈øe, and Terms of Mans fir≈øt Creation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives Man of his Soveraignty over the Creatures, puts Enmity between Man and the Creatures, and accur≈øeth Man, and the Earth for his ≈øake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14. to the end.</p>
            <p>This being the Matter of fact in Mans Creation, under the Penal Law, and his Breach, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion again≈øt God, and the puni≈øhment of his di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we come next to examine the nature of this fir≈øt and original ≈øin, and con≈øider whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted only in this ≈øingle Act, of eating of the Tree of Knowledge; or what other ≈øins were, or are complicated in it.</p>
            <p>If we con≈øider Man as truly endowed by God, with Knowledge, Righteou≈øne≈øs, and true Holine≈øs, and under the Prohibition of a Penal Law, we ≈øhall find all the ≈øins committed and di≈øcovered in after Ages, under the growth of Corruption, to have been in that tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That wilful breach of Gods Law and Sin,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65284:15"/> cannot be palliate, under the excu≈øe of the ≈øin of Ignorance, for that mans knowledge was ≈øtrong and ≈øufficiently clear, to under≈øtand good and evil, and in re≈øpect there was a po≈øitive prohibition again≈øt ≈øuch offence, it mu≈øt imply knowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes it a wilful breach and offence again≈øt a known Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It cannot be called the Sin of Infirmity or ≈øurprize, as <hi>Adam</hi> would have excu≈øed him≈øelf, by the Womans giving of the fruit to him, and the Womans Apology of the Serpents beguiling her; for that they were foretold, that they ≈øhould not Eat of that Fruit, and forbid the eating thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalty of Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12, 13. and that the knowledge they had of good and evil, and that to break the Commandment of God was evil it ≈øelf, although it had not been under the Penalty expre≈ø≈øed, and therefore having in them≈øelves ≈øufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to under≈øtand, and ≈øtrength to defeat and re≈øi≈øt the force and arguments of Satans In≈øinuations, this Sin was a vehement and bold pre≈øumption again≈øt the Ju≈øtice and Authority of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Sin was of the greate≈øt Pride and Ambition imaginable, for that God had endowed Man with knowledge ≈øufficient in every re≈øpect, to make him happy, in under≈øtanding all things to complete his ≈øatisfaction and delight in God, and the Creatures; neverthele≈øs upon Satans In≈øinuation, that, by eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they ≈øhould become more knowing and be like Gods, knowing Good and Evil, they wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Pride and Ambition of their Hearts, lu≈øted after knowledge to be equal with God, and by di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience broke Gods Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Sin was of greate≈øt unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Gods Truth and Ju≈øtice, in believing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Lye, <hi>(you ≈øhall not ≈øurely die,)</hi> Gen. 3.4. and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65284:16"/> Gods word, <hi>thou ≈øhalt ≈øurely die.</hi> Whereby to their own ruin, and ruin of their, Po≈øterity they yeilded to a deceitfully, and did not obey the Truth and righteou≈øne≈øs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This eating of the Tree of Knowledge, implyed the greate≈øt Murmuring, Repining, and Ingratitude, for that God had given to Man, the U≈øe of and Dominion over all the Creatures and had only re≈øerved one ≈øingle Tree, with a Prohibition from meddling with it; neverthele≈øs man is not Content, but mu≈øt have all, not remembring, or willfully forgetting, that he had his beginning and being of God, and what he had, was of and from him, and that he had what was ≈øufficient to make him happy; yet was his Covetou≈øne≈øs without bounds.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This Sin was of the greate≈øt Sloth, imprudence, and inadvertence, in that while God had endowed Man with Knowledge, Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Holine≈øs, when Satan did acco≈øt him, with a Ly, to break the Command, he ≈øhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the Righteou≈øne≈øs and Hoilne≈øs of God, that it was impo≈ø≈øible for God to Lie, and thereby ≈øhould have re≈øi≈øted Satans Sugge≈øtions, founded on a Ly from the Holyne≈øs and Goodne≈øs of God in giving man all things; he ≈øhould have rea≈øoned that it was not ju≈øt in him to murmur at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in mans being re≈øtrained from ≈øome thing, and upon Satans fir≈øt Sugge≈øtion of a Ly again≈øt God, he ≈øhould not have li≈øtned further to him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Credit of Gods truth and continued in his Obedience.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, From the Method of Committing this Sin, all manner of Sin ≈øeems to be employed in it the Text ≈øaith, <hi>And when the Woman ≈øaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that it was plea≈øant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be de≈øired to make one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65284:16"/> wi≈øe: She took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave al≈øo to her Husband with her, and he did eat,</hi> Gen. 3.6.</p>
            <p>From hence we ≈øee when Satan by a lying Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øtion had tampered with the Woman, ay and got her to li≈øten to his temptation, from her ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of (being as Gods) ≈øhe lets her thoughts out to a further ≈øurvey of the apparent excellencies and advantages to be had in the eating of that fruit, and thus ambition kindleth lu≈øt, and one lu≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth another, ≈øo the heart ≈øwelling with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of further Knowledge, and that ambition runs to the Eyes, and from the Eyes to the Sen≈øual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and thus the whole Ma≈øs is tainted and defiled, and let out to the gluttinous poy≈øoning of the Soul to the Rebellion of Di≈øobedience.</p>
            <p>This ≈øeems to be that ≈øame thing which the Apo≈øtle calls <hi>the Lu≈øt of the Fle≈øh, the Lu≈øt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> Which is an entire Ma≈øs of all pollution, ≈øo that it was not only the eating of that fruit which was the Sin only, but the Infection that was got into the Heart and Affections, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the goodly frame of Righteou≈øne≈øs, Holyne≈øs, and true Knowledge became all tainted and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the deceitful Appetites and Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>By</hi> di≈øtru≈øting of God, and then by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous lu≈øting after what was ≈øet apart from them by Gods prohibition, and ≈øo breaking the limits of Obedience, lets the Lu≈øt ≈øwing after a carnal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion or forwardne≈øs to ≈øatiate their de≈øires, and thus di≈øorders the righteous frame of Ju≈øtice, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Knowledge, lately erected by God in them, ≈øo that this Sin was not only that actual and only act of eating the fruit, but the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole faculties run into di≈øorder from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65284:17"/> God, expre≈ø≈øed by that rebellious act of eating the forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>This al≈øo ≈øeems to be proved and explained in many places of Scripture, e≈øpecially tho≈øe of the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul, I had not known Sin, but by the Law: I had not known lu≈øt, except the Law had ≈øaid thou ≈øhalt not Covet;</hi> Rom. 7.7. Where by the word Lu≈øt rendred mo≈øt properly in the Original (Concupi≈øcence) and the word Covet there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.17. is properly meant a de≈øire of what is more than our own, and allowable in Ju≈øtice, and in that place, <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetou≈øne≈øs,</hi> I≈øa. 57.17. Where by Covetou≈øne≈øs is meant the lu≈øtful Inclinations, and by the Apo≈øtle in that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. By lu≈øts he means not ≈øo much the polluted actions of the Fle≈øh as the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted fountain of them, <hi>Non pravas Cupiditates ≈øed illarum fontem;</hi> and the Soul is well called <hi>Sedes Nativae illius labis,</hi> the ≈øeat of that Natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this ≈øeems likewi≈øe to be confirmed by that Scripture and <hi>God ≈øaw that the wickedne≈øs of man was greater in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was evil and only evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> Gen 6.5. Where God chargeth mans heart with this Sin as being the Fountain of the Corruption.</p>
            <p>That of the P≈øalmi≈øt, <hi>The Fool hath ≈øaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> P≈øal. 14.1. Seems to be to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, for none were openly ≈øuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed Athei≈øts as to deny the being of God, but the Prophanity of their Conver≈øation leads the P≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øt to charge them with denying of God, whereby he chargeth the heart with the pollution and brings the act of Sin as In≈øtance and proof of it.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt him≈øelf al≈øo in that Scripture <hi>But tho≈øe things which come out of the mouth, come from the heart,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65284:17"/> and they do defile a man,</hi> Math. 15.18, 19, 20. Seems to confirm this Doctrine that Sin principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con≈øi≈øteth not in the outward acts, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Corruption and Di≈øorder of the affections and mind, for here in this Scripture he brings the words and actions of a man to charge the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart.</p>
            <p>This is explained al≈øo by the Cu≈øtom and Laws of Countries again≈øt Trea≈øon, where Imagining and Con≈øpiring to kill the King is made Trea≈øon and any act which di≈øcovers or proves that Intention is made Trea≈øon, but the main guilt lieth in the malice and rebellious Inclinations of the heart in Con≈øpiring the Kings, Death, and the act is but a proof of it; ≈øo upon the whole matter we find this great tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of Original Sin was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate and di≈øorderly frame of the Spirit of man, let out in di≈øobedience again≈øt God, and having once li≈øtned to temptation, the whole faculties were defiled and did not ≈øtop until man run into actual rebellion again≈øt God; So that we mu≈øt look on Man's corrupt Nature as having in it the Complication of all Lu≈øts and Sins, as the Principal cau≈øe of Gods Wrath and Cur≈øe, and that the act of Di≈øobedience ≈øerved for Gods Evidence to prove the guilt of the heart, and this Corrupt Fountain of Nature with the Cur≈øe for Rebellion have our fir≈øt Parents ≈øent down to all Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And thus we ≈øee man lately Righteous, Holy, Pure, and Undefiled, full of Knowledge, Power, Soveraignty over the Creatures, giving Law to them, and receiving Obedience from them; liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Honour, Glory, Pomp, Plenty, and at Plea≈øure, having all the Creatures in Subjection to him, and none in Competition with him, a Friend of, and at Peace with God; the Darling of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65284:18"/> Creation; having Glory without Envy, Plenty without Toil, Plea≈øure without Trouble; Strength without Infirmities, or Pain; Degraded from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, Clouded with Darkne≈øs, Pe≈øtred with Contention, Oppre≈ø≈øed with Toil, Pinched with Difficulties, Obnoxious to De≈øtruction from ≈øuch who lately were under Subjection to him, an Outlaw to God and Bani≈øhed from his Pre≈øence, his Body a Ma≈øs of Infirmities, and Soul a Cage of unclean Lu≈øts, <hi>The whole Head is Sick, the whole Heart faint, from the Sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no ≈øoundne≈øs in it, but Wounds and Brui≈øes and putrifying Sores,</hi> I≈øa. 1.5. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteou≈øne≈øs are as filthy Rags, and we do all fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the wind have taken us away, &amp;c.</hi> I≈øa. 64.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy name that ≈øtirreth up him≈øelf to take hold of thee, for thou ha≈øt hid thy ≈øelf from us, and ha≈øt con≈øumed us becau≈øe of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities,</hi> I≈øa 64.7.</p>
            <p>Thus having viewed mans e≈øtate in his Creation and Integrity, and con≈øidered his fall and ≈øteps thereof, we come next to examine how far his Po≈øterity is concerned in his guilt, and puni≈øhment thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> being freely Created of God, and by him endowed with excellent Knowledge, Righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and Holyne≈øs, and made Lord over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Covenant of Obedience, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Di≈øobedience, we mu≈øt look on him in the Purpo≈øe of God, as repre≈øenting all mankind; ≈øo as on his performance with God, he ≈øhould continue and hold all the Priviledges he was dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with, and ≈øend them down to his Po≈øteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if he ≈øhould fail, in the Conditions a≈ø≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he was to forfeit all the≈øe Priviledges
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65284:18"/> as well for him≈øelf as Po≈øterity: this is but what was ju≈øt with God, who freely made Man what he was, and might duely claim the di≈øpo≈øal of his own gift upon his own terms; this was only advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to Man having ≈øo fair a bargain <hi>gratis</hi> without price or any purcha≈øe, except that of due Obedience, which he was capable to perform, had he not wilfully corrupted him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>This is illu≈øtrated by the cu≈øtomary practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt Men, for when any man lets Land to Lea≈øe for term of years, re≈øerving a Rent payable at a certain time: if the Rent be not pay'd at the term a≈ø≈øigned, the property reverts and ve≈øts in the Lea≈ø≈øer, and the Tennant is deve≈øted of his term, and of all benefit thereby; but if the Lea≈ø≈øee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, he holds for him≈øelf and a≈ø≈øigns: This al≈øo is clear in that ca≈øe, when a King or Overlord makes a Grant for Service to a Man, and his Heirs, if the Grantee performs, he holds for him≈øelf, and ≈øends the right and benefit of the Grant to his Heirs; but if he fail the Grant is Extinct by his Non-performance; and the Heirs take nothing by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to him, for that his right in his own time was voided, ≈øo could not he ≈øend it down to his Heirs,</p>
            <p>In the Ca≈øe of Trea≈øon, the Ance≈øtors blood is corrupted and he ≈øo dead in Law, that the claim of Succe≈ø≈øion is cut off, ≈øo as the I≈ø≈øue of his Body can make no claim through him; and not only ≈øo, but the Ance≈øtors blood is ≈øo attainted by Act in Law, that the Po≈øterity is not only barred from ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to what the Ance≈øtor held, but the Crime of Rebellion or Trea≈øon is imputed to the Succe≈ø≈øors or Po≈øterity, that in all time coming, their Succe≈ø≈øion is cut off, unle≈øs by Act in Law, the blood be re≈øtored; although the Po≈øterity ≈øhould not be guilty of the Act of Rebellion, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65284:19"/> Trea≈øon, on which the forefeit was declared or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewed: In this ca≈øe two fatal Con≈øequences have hapned to the Po≈øterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By his Act of Di≈øobedience he hath ≈øo far corrupted Nature, ≈øo as thereby the Nature of all Men by Natural Generation is Corrupted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by breaking of the Command, he in his own life time was di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, of the Rich Priviledges ve≈øted in him, and thereby his Po≈øterity were cut off from the claim of right thereunto,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Adam</hi> by his tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion hath corrupted his Nature, and thereby all men by Natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are corrupted, and as partakers of that degenerated Nature, they are guilty of and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>Adams</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion and have lodged in them inherent Corruption.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> by the many enormous ≈øteps of his Di≈øobedience above mentioned, hath not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Wrath of God, but al≈øo Corrupted his Nature; doth thereby appear, by what has been already ≈øaid, in the Concomitants or ≈øpecial ≈øteps of that Di≈øobedience; for it was ≈øimply impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ≈øo many irregularities could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in any one Act, as have appeared in this; if the whole Nature had not been polluted, the very Act in the Circum≈øtances of it clearly prove it, for that ≈øo many different Concomitants would have jarred and marred that Act, if the chief propen≈øion of the Affections and Natural Di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had not joyned, whereby we mu≈øt agree, that the whole Ma≈øs was Corrupted and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiracy to rebellion again≈øt God.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> by his Apo≈øtacy from God did defile his Nature from the fir≈øt purity, and that all men ≈øince are the ≈øeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> we mu≈øt infer that all men by Natural Generation are of a Corrupted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65284:19"/> race and naturally defiled, and con≈øequently origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal guilt imputable to them, in ≈øo much as they are part of that Ma≈øs which was corrupted: common experience in all Ages tell us, that unhappy con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Parents, either natural, or accidental, render Po≈øterity exceeding corrupt as well in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals as in bodily habits, and what rea≈øon can be given, why men beget men, and not bea≈øts, and bea≈øts beget bea≈øts, and not men, but becau≈øe of the Affinity of Nature, between the Sire and what is begotten? the ≈øame Parity of rea≈øon will infer, that from corrupt Men, corrupt I≈ø≈øue mu≈øt be produced, and how can it be otherwi≈øe ≈øuppo≈øed? for what is begotten of man, can give no quality to it ≈øelf, and therefore mu≈øt participate of the nature, and a≈øcribe its quality to that by which it is begotten.</p>
            <p>This al≈øo is clear from Scripture, <hi>who can bring a clean thing from an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4.</p>
            <p>If a man be ≈øinful, polluted and unclean, as <hi>Adam</hi> was after his fall, how could his Po≈øterity be clean, they have it not of them≈øelves, and could not claim or derive it from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> gives us for this a clear Scripture proof, in his own acknowledgment of Original guilt <hi>behold I was ≈øhapen in iniquity, and in ≈øin did my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> P≈øal. 51.5.</p>
            <p>From whence comes this pollution of <hi>David,</hi> the Embrio took it not from its lodging in the Womb, there being nothing there to defile it, therefore it mu≈øt needs have it from its polluted Parents.</p>
            <p>Do not dayly and woful experience in≈øtruct us, that the fir≈øt Acts of Children is wickedne≈øs, and if not re≈øtrained, and in≈øtructed, they will peri≈øh in Sin and Athei≈øm? whence comes this? Man was created Righteous and Holy, untill he wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed him≈øelf, doth not then this wickedne≈øs ari≈øe from that fir≈øt pollution of Nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ≈øo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65284:20"/> de≈øcended and fell on all Po≈øterity, and continues ≈øucce≈ø≈øively until Nature be poli≈øhed by Grace, and man be renewed in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Image of him that Created him, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, and true holine≈øs? wherefore we mu≈øt conclude all men under Sin by natural Generation, and for this the Scripture is mo≈øt clear, <hi>for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin,</hi> and in that other place of the ≈øame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, <hi>Wherefore as by one Man, ≈øin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, ≈øo Death pa≈ø≈øed upon all Men, for that all have ≈øinned,</hi> Rom. 3.9. Again, <hi>therefore as by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. For as by one Mans Di≈øobedience, many were made Sinners, ≈øo by the Obedience of one ≈øhall many be made Righteous.</hi> Rom. 5.12, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Having di≈øcovered from Scripture, and by other arguments, that by <hi>Adams</hi> Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, his Nature was corrupted, and that thereby his Po≈øterity, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his corrupted complexion and nature, are al≈øo tainted with his corruption, and are thereby guilty of his original Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, we come next to con≈øider the con≈øequences thereof upon his Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the≈øe are twofold.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Po≈øterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> are made ≈øubject to Death, and di≈øabled from ≈øucceeding him in the many priviledges he enjoyed in his Integrity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are di≈øabled in natural enjoyment and ≈øpiritual performances.</p>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, as we have already cleared, upon <hi>Adams</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion an act of attender pa≈ø≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, and he was deprived of his Soveraignty over the Creatures, enmity was ≈øowed between him and them, and the Earth was accur≈øed for his ≈øake, and he him≈øelf expo≈øed to toil, mi≈øery, and ≈øorrow, ≈øo that all the≈øe evil effects have fallen on his Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and they al≈øo made ≈øubject to Death. This is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65284:20"/> already cleared from their participation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and con≈øequently, the Judgments which have followed mu≈øt al≈øo affect them, and they are thereby brought under the Judgment of Death, as by that Scripture already cited, <hi>as by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, ≈øo Death pa≈ø≈øed upon all men, for that all men have ≈øinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. So as <hi>Adam</hi> had not ≈øeen Death if he had not ≈øinned; and ≈øinning was brought under the Judgment of Death, all his Po≈øterity likewi≈øe ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him, are liable to the Judgment of Death, <hi>For the Wages of ≈øin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Po≈øterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are not only di≈øabled, from ≈øucceeding him in that glorious ≈øtate of his Integrity, but are di≈øabled in the u≈øe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enjoyment, and ≈øpiritual performances.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In natural and temporary enjoyments, for though the World be re≈øpited from utter ruine, and God continues Man on Earth with a Cour≈øe of Day and Night, and the u≈øual ≈øea≈øons, neverthele≈øs ≈øince the Cur≈øe on the Creatures for Mans Sin, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Creature delights is attended with ≈øuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øine≈øs, that Mans Life is a continual dying, and a Life of Sorrow, <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is of few days, and full of trouble, he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down, he flieth al≈øo as a ≈øhadow, and continueth not.</hi> Job 14.1, 2.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Davids</hi> te≈øtimony of the greate≈øt of Men, ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Men of low degree are vanity, and Men of high degree a lye, to be laid in the hallance, they are altogether lighter than vanity,</hi> P≈øal. 62.9. If we take <hi>Solomons</hi> opinion of the whole World, he plainly tells us, <hi>all is Vanity and Vexation of Spirit,</hi> Eccle≈ø. 2. all. The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle gives us an Inventory of the World, <hi>In the World is only the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, the Lu≈øts of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life; and the≈øe things are not of God and peri≈øh in the u≈øing.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16. The holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65284:21"/> Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, that <hi>the whole Creation is brought under ≈øubjection, and groans under bondage for Sin.</hi> Rom. 8.20, 21. So that ≈øince the Cur≈øe for Sin, the World is but a Stage of Sin, Sorrow, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery.</p>
            <p>This al≈øo is proved from daily experience, what Age, Nation, City, or Family is exempted from the la≈øh of mortality, mi≈øery or changes? is not the greate≈øt Earthly glory, honour, wealth and ≈øtrength, clouded in a moment and brought to nothing? and this is the ju≈øt effect of mans Sin and Rebellion, and will be the continuing Lot of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Re≈øtoration of Man in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Image of him that created him, and that the bondage of the Creation be re≈øtored by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ≈øecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and re≈øtitution of all things by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21, 22.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing wherein Man is di≈øabled by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Sin, and inherent Corruption from the fir≈øt pollution, is not only natural feeblene≈øs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, all the vital and corporal faculties being di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, from that original, whole≈øome, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Con≈øtitution of the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby the actions are either corrupt or faint, in compari≈øon with what they were before the Fall; but al≈øo in Religious performances and duties, ≈øo as all the≈øe actions, and performances, are either wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ≈øinful, or ≈øo weak, and ≈øcanty, that they are rather a Skeleton or Picture, than real Duties.</p>
            <p>This is illu≈øtrated from the≈øe three In≈øtances.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, From the corruption of the Fountain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From daily experience.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, From the corruption of the Fountain of our actions, or performance of Duties; It being already proved, that Man, having wilfully polluted and di≈øordered the frame of Holine≈øs, Integrity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65284:21"/> and Knowledge, in which he was created, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned the Heart and Affections, from whence acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and performances do flow, how can pure and full performances or duties be expected from thence? Man being in his Heart and Thoughts pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, his Actions mu≈øt be ≈øuitable; <hi>to the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled is nothing pure, but even their Mind and Con≈øcience is defiled.</hi> Tit. 1.15. This is of nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we mu≈øt conclude, that ≈øo long as the Fountain of the Heart is defiled, ≈øo mu≈øt the actions and performances coming from thence be impure and weak, and until <hi>Man be renewed in the Spirit of his Mind,</hi> by regeneration in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he ≈øtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains corrupt and polluted until he be again reve≈øted with that holy Spirit and that a new heart be given to him, by which again he may be enabled to walk in the Statutes of God to do them, by vertue of that promi≈øe, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cau≈øe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ≈øhall keep my Judgments and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Scripture is mo≈øt clear, that all the Actions of a Carnal Man (≈øuch as are all the I≈ø≈øue of <hi>Adam</hi> until re≈øtored by Regeneration) are ≈øinful, and unacceptable with God.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, His Thoughts are polluted and defiled, <hi>and God ≈øaw that the wickedne≈øs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart, was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His words are defiled and ≈øinful, <hi>but unto the wicked God ≈øaith, what ha≈øt thou to do to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my Statutes, and take my Covenant in thy Mouth, ≈øeeing thou hate≈øt In≈øtruction, and ca≈øteth my Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee?</hi> P≈øal. 50.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Actions are all evil, <hi>the Ploughing of the Wicked is ≈øin,</hi> Prov. 21.4.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65284:22"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The very Religious Actions or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Duties of the Wicked are ≈øinful. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. <hi>He that turneth away his Ear from hearing the Law, even his Prayer ≈øhall be an abomination,</hi> Prov. 28.9. <hi>When ye ≈øpread forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you, yea when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, your hands are full of blood,</hi> I≈øa. 1.11 <hi>to</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>This point we may thus conclude, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flows from a Carnal Man, who≈øe Mind and Heart is defiled, mu≈øt be impure and unacceptable to God, for that <hi>the Carnal Mind is enmity again≈øt God, and is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Wherefore until the Fountain be purified, and the imbred prejudice of the Heart be taken away, and man be reconciled to God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, nothing coming from him can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Experience clearly proves, ≈øuch di≈øabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in every performance, Religion for mo≈øt part is wrapt up, in a bare exerci≈øe of outward actions of Devotion; Formality, Ceremony, and cu≈øtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry performances, are come in ≈øuch repute that men ea≈øily deceive them≈øelves and ≈øit down at ea≈øe in the≈øe performances, without ≈øearching into the frame of the Spirit towards God, or examining the ≈øpring and motive of the≈øe Duties, or ≈øcope and end of their Devotion, not regarding whether the≈øe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be undertaken and performed, in obedience of the Command, in Faith, in Sen≈øe of Sin, in Eye to the Glory of God, or remor≈øe for Sin, in ≈øen≈øe of ≈øelf pollution, and in a de≈øire of renovation and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to perform, and in every thing to deny our ≈øelves, and depend on God by Faith; but lull their Con≈øciences for mo≈øt part ≈øecure, by having done
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65284:22"/> what was cu≈øtomarily reputed religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>Let a Man pretending to religion more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, examine him≈øelf impartially, he ≈øhall find ≈øuch di≈øorder of Thoughts in religious duties, ≈øuch narrow and ≈øcanty apprehen≈øions of God, ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va≈øion of his Thoughts and Affections, diverting him from the right, and leading him to improper objects, unruly interruptions, ≈øuch ≈øcanty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and ≈øuch unea≈øine≈øs under the≈øe duties, that Cu≈øtom rather than Con≈øcience (and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience for Self) if not carnal Intere≈øt at be≈øt, than for Gods Glory and Salvation, is the chief Impul≈øe or Spring of ≈øuch actions. But as to the arraigning of the Affection before God, whether placed on God, or Lu≈øts; Faith on Chri≈øt for Ju≈øtification, and Salvation, the work of Mortification, unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repentance, Chri≈øtian Patience, Charity, Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love, and new Obedience, are Riddles, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hid from Carnal apprehen≈øions, and made mens duties, but rather thought nu≈øancies, ≈øcare crows, and enmity to the World and the fle≈øh; ≈øo that we mu≈øt conclude, that in nature we are without ≈øtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>h, for any Righteous performances, and that until the Law of the Members be brought under the Law of the Spirit, we can do no good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>For I know that in me, that is in my Fle≈øh, dwelleth no good thing, for to will is pre≈øent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>For I ≈øee a Law in my Members, warring again≈øt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of ≈øin, which is in my Members.</hi> Chap. 7.23. Here we have a clear de≈øcription and proof of mans natural Incapacity for doing any good, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity we mu≈øt a≈øcribe to the corruption of the Heart &amp; Affections, which had its ri≈øe from ≈øin in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having cleared what Original Sin in <hi>Adam</hi> was,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65284:23"/> and how his Po≈øterity was tainted therewith, and made liable to the fatal Con≈øequences thereof, we come in the third place to make ≈øome practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from thence.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If from the premi≈øes it be an unque≈øtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Perfection, and Integrity, and that he fell under the mo≈øt dete≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Apo≈øtacy, and that in his Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion were complicated all manner of Sins, that Nature was polluted in him, that all after Po≈øterity are tainted with his guilt, and made liable to the con≈øequences of his Sin. How little rea≈øon have the greate≈øt and riche≈øt Men of the World, to boa≈øt, and how great rea≈øon have they to humble them≈øelves, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of their Pedigree?</p>
            <p>For that their de≈øcent was from him, who once was the mo≈øt glorious, ab≈øolute, riche≈øt, and only Soveraign on Earth, who for his Pride, Covetou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Ingratitude, and Murmuring, was forfeit, degraded, made mi≈øerable, and deba≈øed, That they are at be≈øt, of corrupted, adulterate and degenerate blood, and extraction, Scripture doth clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>to know her abominations, thy Birth and thy Nativity is of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>thy Father was an Amorite, thy Mother a Hittite,</hi> Ezek. 16, 23.</p>
            <p>This People was lineally of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but had followed the Idolatry, and wickedne≈øs of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and Hittites, therefore are they ≈øaid to be of that Pedigree; we ≈øee Chri≈øt would not ≈øuffer the Scribes and Phari≈øees among≈øt the Jews, to claim to <hi>Abraham,</hi> becau≈øe they did not his works, we ≈øee the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> chargeth the Jews to be an adulterous race, and that they were of a Mother divorced from her Husband, <hi>where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorcement, whom I have put away? behold for your Iniquities, have you ≈øold your ≈øelves, and for your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions is your Mother put away,</hi> I≈øa. 51.1.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65284:23"/>
            <p>What glory is it to be of noble blood, which for the wor≈øt of Crimes was attainted, and to be of Illu≈øtrious birth, when the I≈ø≈øue is Adulterous and Spurious? this is the Fountain and Spring of the Blood and Pedigree of all Mankind, of higher or lower degree on Earth, and this cro≈øs bar is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Scutcheon of all Mortals, this is that <hi>Men√© Tek√©l,</hi> Dan. 5.25. the Motto of all the natural I≈ø≈øue of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this ≈øtain is not to be blotted out, but by the Blood of that Scape Goat, the Lamb, Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who mu≈øt blot out <hi>the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that was again≈øt us, contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Cro≈øs,</hi> Col. 2.14.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, When by Providence Affliction or Cha≈øti≈øement for ≈øin cometh, con≈øider, that before Sin came, there was no ≈øorrow, that Ju≈øtice and Judgment mu≈øt attend Iniquity, and as Sin was fir≈øt puni≈øhed by a deluge of mi≈øery on Mankind, ≈øo the Continuance mu≈øt not e≈øcape the like fate; and look on all acts as coming from that Fountain of Corruption, and make not the ≈øingle act of any one tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, the ≈øole cau≈øe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repentance, and reformation, but run the act to the ≈øpring of the Heart, and fix on the Soul that vehement de≈øire, fear, zeal, indignation and revenge in the act, and corruption in the fountain, <hi>what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65284:24"/> Indignation, yea what fear, what vehement de≈øire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge!</hi> and never meet with any ≈øin or temptation to it, but with an Eye of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie as over a Pit of De≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When Providence deprives thee of any Earthly enjoyment, for the rea≈øons in Divine Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, murmur not to be denied ≈øome of thy de≈øires, but remember thou wa≈øt guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> of grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God the re≈øerving of the Tree of Knowledge, and by thy impatient bearing of lo≈ø≈øes thou make≈øt the old ≈øore of <hi>Adams</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion bleed afre≈øh in di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but rather let the memory of Original Sin, oblige thee, to ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, contentment, ≈øorrow and repentance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Are all men guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are of the ≈øame corrupted and degenerate blood, and ≈øome by cour≈øe of Providence rai≈øed to Wealth and Honour above others, what rea≈øon then hath the exalted, or brother of high degree, to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øe him on whom the deceitful Riches of this World, have not ≈ømiled? this Man who di≈øpi≈øeth his Brother, is forgetful of him≈øelf, as if not of the ≈øame blood with the other, <hi>he is like a man beholding his natural Face in a gla≈øs, he beholdeth him≈øelf, and goeth away, and forgetteth what manner of Man he was,</hi> Jam. 1.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The Riches, and Honour of this Life, ≈øhould not rai≈øe a Man in e≈øteem of him≈øelf above his brother, for what he hath is given to him of God, who can as equally level him with his Brother, and thereby make him remember his own Pride, and that the other is of the ≈øame Blood with him. See the In≈øtance of this in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and many others. <hi>I</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, <hi>prai≈øe and extol, and honour the King of Heaven, all who≈øe Works are Truth, and his ways Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tho≈øe that walk in Pride he is able to aba≈øe.</hi> Dan. 4.29. to the end.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65284:24"/>
            <p>Con≈øider what the Apo≈øtle <hi>James</hi> ≈øaith of Carnal partiality, of preferring the Rich in Gay Clothing, with a goodly Gold Ring, and de≈øpi≈øing the poor Brother, and what arguments he u≈øeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Are ye not then partial in your ≈øelves, and are become Judges of evil thoughts? hath not God cho≈øen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he hath promi≈øed to tho≈øe that love him, and ye have di≈øpi≈øed the Poor? do not Rich Men oppre≈øs you, and draw you before the Judgment Seats, do not they bla≈øpheme that worthy name by which ye are called? if ye fulfil that royal Law, according to the Scripture, (thou ≈øhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ≈øelf) ye do well, but if you have re≈øpect to per≈øons ye ≈øin,</hi> Jam. 2. to 10.</p>
            <p>Here by ≈øtrong arguments he proves the partial preferring the Rich before the poor to be ≈øinful.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For that the Godly though poor in this World, is the worthier per≈øon in Gods e≈øteem, in that he is cho≈øen of God, an heir of the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Great and Rich Men, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Godly, they bring them before Judgment Seats, and oppre≈øs them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Rich Men are not Enemies only to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, but to God, and Bla≈øpheme his Holy Name.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the royal Law of God commands the Duty of equal love, love thy Neighbour as thy ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ≈øince Pride, and Ambition, was a cheif ingredient of that fir≈øt Fountain of ≈øin, let none through Pride, di≈øpi≈øe him who was of the ≈øame blood with him≈øelf, though not in that equal Worldly Splendor or Glory, but con≈øider, as Pride did ruine <hi>Adam,</hi> and aba≈øed all his Po≈øterity, ≈øo Ju≈øtice will take the like vengeance upon all the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> guilty of the ≈øame Crime. <hi>Who≈øo

            <p>Sixthly, Are all men of one Blood and Family, and ≈øo Brethren and <hi>Members one of another?</hi> Eph. 4.24. This calls all men to mutual Sympathy, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual A≈ø≈øi≈øtance and ≈øupply of one another, this is that expre≈øs Command of Chri≈øt, <hi>that ye love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as I have loved you,</hi> John 13.34. And the Apo≈øtle pre≈ø≈øeth this mo≈øt vehemently; <hi>Who≈øoever doeth not righteou≈øne≈øs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> 1 John 3.10. <hi>We have pa≈ø≈øed from Death to Life if we love the Brethren, and he that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death; he that hateth his Brother is a murderer and hath not Eternal Life: We ought to Lay down our Life for the Brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>This Love con≈øi≈øts not only in the Airy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of profe≈ø≈øed and pretended Friend≈øhip, but</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In a general Sympathy, Fellow-feeling, and Compa≈ø≈øion, in all Conditions, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances Spiritual and Temporal, like Chri≈øts Love to his Church: <hi>In all their Afflictions he was Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angel of his pre≈øence ≈øaved them; in his Love, and in his Pity, he redeemed them, and carryed them all the days of old,</hi> I≈øa. 63.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Love is exten≈øive to all wants and nece≈ø≈øities or el≈øe it is empty and profiteth not: <hi>Who≈øo hath this Worlds good, and ≈øeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have need, and ≈øhutteth up his bowels of Compa≈ø≈øion, how doth the Love of God dwell in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17.

            <p>Seventhly, Is it ≈øo then of a lamentable truth, that all men are concluded in <hi>Adams</hi> Apo≈øtacy, and that there is a woful Degeneracy in the Soul of Man, from that primitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Holine≈øs, and <hi>that all men in Nature are dead in Sin, and have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation with the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, fulfilling the de≈øires thereof, and of the mind, according to the Cour≈øe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air; the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Di≈øobedience, and are by Nature the Children of Wrath.</hi> Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. And that there is even among≈øt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>a Law in the Members warring again≈øt the Law in the Mind,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Ch. 8.1.

            <p>Seeing then this Earth is but a ≈øojourning, and no abiding place, and that here is neither Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, Re≈øt, nor Happine≈øs; how much is it mortal mans concern, anxiou≈øly, re≈øtle≈øly, and with a believing Impatience to pur≈øue clo≈øe after the≈øe two things?</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65284:29"/> who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Coun≈øellor?</hi> Rom. 11.33, 34. And with the ≈øame Apo≈øtle, <hi>That ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and to know the love of Chri≈øt which pa≈ø≈øeth Knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulne≈øs of God,</hi> Eph. 3.17, 18, 19. And to admire Infinite Goodne≈øs with the Holy Prophet, <hi>For ≈øince the beginning of the World, Man hath not heard, nor perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye ≈øeen, O God be≈øides thee, what he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him,</hi> I≈øa. 64.4. And further of the mi≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this love, read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 139.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed the fir≈øt e≈øtate of Man in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and his e≈øtate of Apo≈øtacy from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of the mi≈øtery of Gods Love, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good Will to Man, in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, we come next to con≈øider, how in infinite Wi≈ødom the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man is contrived.</p>
            <p>We have already di≈øcovered how God of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made man in a happy and glorious e≈øtate after his own Image, and upon the Condition and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of obedience, he was made Lord of all the ≈øublunary Creatures, and that God putting Mans Stock in his own hand, and though he was ≈øufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enabled to perform Obedience, neverthele≈øs through the Concupi≈øence of his Heart he broke his Allegiance to God, and incurred to him≈øelf and po≈øterity the forfeiture of all the glorious Dignities and Priviledges given to him, and he and his Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were concluded under Mi≈øery and Wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of Sin, ≈øo that having no capacity in him≈øelf to be reconciled to God, and retrieve his lo≈øs, the Infinite Wi≈ødom and Bounty of God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as above is di≈øcovered, did determine mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoration to a better and ≈øurer E≈øtate and Condition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65284:29"/> than what he was in at his fir≈øt Creation, and that ≈øame Infinite Wi≈ødom fore≈øeeing that Man having corrupted his Way and Heart, the Fountain of Actions, <hi>And that the Thoughts and Imaginations of his Heart were evil and only evil continually,</hi> Gen 6.5. <hi>And that his Heart was deceitful and de≈øperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17.9. And though he intended Mans Re≈øtoration and Eternal Happine≈øs, yet becau≈øe of the pravity of Mans Heart, he was neither to be treated with upon his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, nor fit to be tru≈øted with a new Stock in his own ≈øtrength, and therefore Heavenly Wi≈ødom, appoints the only begotten Son of God, and Second Per≈øon of the Holy Trinity to be a Mediator for Man, and by him enters into an everla≈øting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Man, which ≈øhall be demon≈øtrated in the en≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe, and that as well to ≈øatisfie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ju≈øtice for Mans Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, as to ≈øecure to Man the future Stock of Gods bounty, granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by vertue of this New and Second Covenant, and what this Covenant is and the terms of it ≈øhall be the next Subject of Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
            <p>This Covenant commonly called the Covenant of Grace: is mutual between God and Man through the Mediator Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who in Scripture is called the Mediator of the New Covenant: con≈øidering this Covenant, we ≈øhall</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Take notice of the freedom thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of the terms of it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As to the freedom, It being apparent that God of his Free-Will and Goodne≈øs, without any tye, nece≈ø≈øity, or obligation upon him, for his own Glory, Created the World and Man, in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ≈øtately Condition as we have heard, and that Man by his Rebellion departing from God, had incurred the execution of Ju≈øtice upon him≈øelf, and all after Po≈øterity, and that the Pravity of Mans Nature was ≈øuch, that it grieved and repented
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65284:30"/> God that he had made Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. There lay no obligation upon God to re≈øtore lo≈øt Man, but that God intending to make Bounty and Mercy, as it were, to triumph over Ju≈øtice, and magnifie his Infinite goodne≈øs; by the Council of Heaven, this my≈øtery of Chri≈øts love is contrived, by which Ju≈øtice is ≈øatisfied, and Man is not only relieved from the ≈øervitude of Sin, and delivered from wrath to come, and in≈øured in a better e≈øtate than what he was in at fir≈øt, but al≈øo is made Heir to all the mo≈øt excellent priviledges contained in this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which ≈øhall be branched forch in the en≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
            <p>The frequent te≈øtimonies of the Spirit in the New Te≈øtament, witne≈øs the freedom of this Covenant. <hi>Having Prede≈øtinated us to the Adoption of Children by Je≈øus Chri≈øt to him≈øelf according to the good plea≈øure of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. <hi>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in ≈øins, hath he quickened us together in Chri≈øt; by Grace ye are ≈øaved,</hi> Eph. 2.4, 5, 11. <hi>And not by Works of Righteou≈øne≈øs which we have done, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Mercy he ≈øaved us, by the wa≈øhing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and renewing of the Holy Gho≈øt, which he ≈øhed on us, abundantly, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Saviour, that being Ju≈øtified by his Grace, we ≈øhould be made Heirs according to the hope of Eternal Life,</hi> Titus 3.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all have ≈øinned and come ≈øhort of the Glory of God, being ju≈øtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, whom God hath ≈øet forth, to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteou≈øne≈øs for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, that are pa≈øt, through the forbearance of God, to declare his righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs that he may be ju≈øt, and the ju≈øtifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Je≈øus,</hi> Rom. 3.21, to the end. <hi>When we were yet without ≈øtrength in due time Chri≈øt died for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65284:30"/> ungodly, God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet Sinners, Chri≈øt died for us, for if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ≈øhall be ≈øaved by his Life,</hi> Rom 5.6, to 11. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was rai≈øed again for our Ju≈øtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. and other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 15, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. to 15, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.17, to 33. <hi>James</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>By all which we ≈øee the ble≈ø≈øing of this Covenant coming freely of Grace, by the Council of Heaven, Chri≈øt undertaking for impotent, helple≈øs ≈øinners, and enemies, and this undertaking approved and accepted of, by the forbearance of God and the ≈øuffering of Chri≈øt, coming as a propitiation and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Ju≈øtice for Mans offences, who was in no capacity to help him≈øelf, the freedom and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this love of Chri≈øt in this new Covenant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, yet more particularly in the≈øe re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As man was of him≈øelf incapable to make ≈øatisfaction to Ju≈øtice, and reconcile him≈øelf to God, ≈øo he was not fit to be treated with by God in his own per≈øon, becau≈øe he had altogether defiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and was of no Integrity, therefore Je≈øus Chri≈øt becomes Mans Surety to God, to perform for him the Conditions on Mans part, which he doth by offering him≈øelf up to Ju≈øtice for Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. And by his Spirit of Grace enabling Man to do ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual homage and obedience to God, <hi>and by ≈øo much was Je≈øus made the Surety of a better Te≈øtament,</hi> Heb. 2.22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chri≈øt doth not onely become Mans Surety, but actually clears and di≈øcharges them from the debt of Sin to Ju≈øtice, and frees Sinners from the penalty of eternal wrath for Sin, <hi>for he hath made him to be ≈øin for us, who knew no ≈øin, that we might be made the Righteou≈øne≈øs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65284:31"/>
            <p>Herein doth the Surety≈øhip of Chri≈øt for Man differ from the ≈øurety≈øhip among≈øt Men, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt Men, when one becometh Surety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he contracts for relief from him who≈øe ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he is, and only lends his Credit for a time, but will not pay the debt for him, if he can by Law avoid it, and if he be con≈øtrained to pay it, he will force relief from the other if he be able, and if not able, will treat him with all ≈øeverity for his own relief; but Chri≈øt Je≈øus neither expects or de≈øires any ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction or relief, but freely of his own good Will pays the Debt and expects no return but the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thankful acknowledgment and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mercy of forgivene≈øs and priviledges obtained by him to the debtor.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He becomes a Cur≈øe for ≈øinners, and frees them from the Cur≈øe due for their ≈øins, <hi>Chri≈øt hath redeemed us from the Cur≈øe of the Law being made a Cur≈øe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>For it is Written, Cur≈øed is every one that hangeth on a Tree,</hi> Deut. 21.23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He doth not only free us from the Cur≈øe for Sin, and Puni≈øhment of Ju≈øtice, but al≈øo frees them from all Imputation of guilt for Sin, and obtains the condemnatory Sentence of Ju≈øtice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, to be cancelled and nailed to his Cro≈øs of Satisfaction to Ju≈øtice, that the ≈øame ≈øhall never retort upon them to their prejudice, <hi>And you being dead in your Sins, and the Uncircumci≈øion of the Fle≈øh, hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven you all Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that was again≈øt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way nailing it to his Cro≈øs,</hi> Colo≈ø≈øians 2.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Herein al≈øo is a ≈øecond difference between Chri≈øts love to me, above that among≈øt men, for when a ≈øurety is obliged to pay the Debt of another, he taketh A≈ø≈øigments to the Creditors Debt, and keeps
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65284:31"/> it on foot again≈øt his Friend, either to force ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from him, or to keep him in con≈øtant trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fear, danger, and di≈øquiet of mind, but Chri≈øt doth not only, early, chearfully, and willingly pay the debt, but al≈øo cancels all the in≈øtruments of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puts the debt in utter oblivion. <hi>And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members their ≈øins no more,</hi> I≈øa. 43.25. and quiets their Thoughts from the fear of their danger, or after trouble for their Debts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He doth not only ≈øatisfie Ju≈øtice, take off the Cur≈øe, and procure them Indemnity, but al≈øo procures the Imputation of Righteou≈øne≈øs to them, as he was made ≈øin for ≈øinner, though he knew no ≈øin, ≈øo he makes them righteous through him, though they were altogether unrighteous in them≈øelves. <hi>And he received the Sign of Circumci≈øion, a ≈øign of the Righteou≈øne≈øs of Faith, which he had yet being uncircumci≈øed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not circumci≈øed, that the righteou≈øne≈øs might be imputed to them al≈øo; now it was not written for his ≈øake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us al≈øo to whom it ≈øhall be imputed, if we believe in him who rai≈øed up Je≈øus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and was rai≈øed again for our Ju≈øtification,</hi> Rom. 4.11, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Herein is manife≈øt the excellency of Chri≈øts love to ≈øinners above any thing among≈øt men, for men commonly upbraid others with their good offices done, and if one man ≈øuffer the lea≈øt injury from another, e≈øpecially in paying a debt for him, the ≈øame is not only a continual reproach, but prejudice ≈øo far prevails, that they never afterwards a≈ø≈øi≈øt them in any good office, but rather defame and le≈ø≈øen their reputation, than advance them to any good, though it may be in their power; but Chri≈øt glorieth in the good Office done, and is ≈øo far from upbraiding his poor friends, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. That he will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65284:32"/> not only have all names of reproach (from their former tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions) taken off, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 54.4. but he will have them farther advanced, and though they were in them≈øelves unrighteous, he will have his own righteou≈øne≈øs imputed to them, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and is ≈øo tender of their reputation, that he will have all their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities covered and wa≈øhed away in his own blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Who gave him≈øelf for us that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all Iniquity, and purify to him≈øelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.23, 24. <hi>Who gave him≈øelf for us, that he might deliver us from this pre≈øent evil World, according to the Will of God and our Father,</hi> Gal. 1.4.</p>
            <p>We do not read in Scripture that Chri≈øt upbraids any Repenting Sinner with their Sins committed before their Conver≈øion, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> after her Conver≈øion was not reproached with uncleanne≈øs, <hi>Peter</hi> with denial of Chri≈øt, nor <hi>Paul</hi> for his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment per≈øecuting of him. This of upbraiding or reproaching the Penitent with their former tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øions is clear contrary to the Method God takes with his People, for in that famous Scripture, <hi>Eze.</hi> 33, The Spirit of God tells us the Righteou≈øne≈øs of the Sinner ≈øhall not ju≈øtify him without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new Obedience, <hi>When I ≈øhall ≈øay to the Righteous he ≈øhall ≈øurely live, if he tru≈øt to his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs and commit Iniquity, all his Righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øhall not be remembred, but for his Iniquity that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited he ≈øhall dye for it,</hi> ver≈øe 13. And on the other hand the Sins of the Penitent ≈øhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred again≈øt them. <hi>If the wicked re≈øtore the pledge, give again that which he hath robbed, and walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity, he ≈øhall ≈øurely live, he ≈øhall not dye, none of his Sins that he hath committed ≈øhall be mentioned unto him, he hath done that which is lawful and right, he ≈øhall ≈øurely live,</hi> ver. 15, 16.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65284:32"/>
            <p>The Lord is a Spirit of meekne≈øs, tender hearted and compa≈ø≈øionate, and he knoweth that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are a people afflicted and broken in Heart for their Sins, and under a continual ≈øen≈øe of being under a body of death, and that they often want the <hi>Oil of Joy for mourning, and the garment of prai≈øe for the ≈øpirit of heavine≈øs,</hi> I≈øa. 61.3. To ≈øupport them under their fainting fits, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> therefore in his gracious conde≈øcen≈øion he mini≈øters con≈øolation to his People. <hi>Thus ≈øaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, who≈øe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him al≈øo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones, for I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth for the Spirit ≈øhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made,</hi> I≈øa. 57.15, 16.</p>
            <p>From whence we may have the≈øe two Le≈ø≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, A Le≈ø≈øon of Caution, Humiliation, and Watchfulne≈øs to the Godly and Penitent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An advice again≈øt cen≈øoriou≈øne≈øs and ra≈øh judging of others.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As to Godly and Penitent, ha≈øt thou upon ≈øerious enquiry into thine own Heart, Affections, and Conver≈øation, found that Godly ≈øorrow and repentance for ≈øin ≈øpoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. And explained in this en≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe, <hi>Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ha≈øt found Faith warranting thee to believe that Chri≈øt Je≈øus who knew no ≈øin, is made ≈øin for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And thou made the Righteou≈øne≈øs of God in him, and that the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Gods Ju≈øtice as to thee, is by him blotted out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14. Then con≈øider,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, What thou art called unto, <hi>That as ye have learned Chri≈øt Je≈øus, ≈øo walk ye in him.</hi> Hath he made thee Righteou≈øne≈øs who was dead in tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes and ≈øins, not by thine own work of Righteou≈øne≈øs, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65284:33"/> of his Grace, and by his Power of Regeneration, art thou ju≈øtified) not by the Law of thy Works, but by Grace and Faith in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.27, 28.</p>
            <p>T,hy works are only Obedience, Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs which are given to thee by him, and though they neither have ju≈øtified nor can ju≈øtify thee, they are thy duties, and what thou can≈øt do is but duty, and thou ≈øhould≈øt account thy ≈øelf an unprofitable Servant as to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. And though in the acceptance of God through Je≈øus Chri≈øt, thou art accounted Righteous, thou mu≈øt continue in holy duties, in all manner of conver≈øation, and mu≈øt not continue in Sin, that Grace may abound, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ≈øin and crucified in Chri≈øt, thou ≈øhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt walk in newne≈øs of life to the de≈øtruction of the body of Death, that we may live with Chri≈øt, <hi>Let not therefore Sin reign in your Mortal bodies, that you ≈øhould obey it in the lu≈øts thereof, neither yield ye your Members as In≈øtruments of unrighteou≈øne≈øs to Sin, but yield unto God as tho≈øe that are alive from the dead, and your Members as In≈øtruments of Righteou≈øne≈øs unto God; and ≈øin not, becau≈øe thou art not under the Law but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6. to 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Art thou in thy apprehen≈øions renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and ha≈øt a loathing ≈øen≈øe of Corruptions, is the Bond-woman of Sin and Satan, ca≈øt out by the power of Regeneration and Grace, leave not thy hou≈øe empty, but get it fre≈øhly ≈øtockt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of Grace, con≈øider what Chri≈øt ≈øaith of the Man out of which the Devil was ca≈øt out, that if he find the Hou≈øe empty, <hi>he will return with ≈øeven Devils wor≈øe than him≈øelf, and the la≈øt ≈øtate of that man will be wor≈øe than the fir≈øt,</hi> Luk. 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Be in≈øtant therefore in Prayer to God for increa≈øe of Grace, and Guard again≈øt old favourite Lu≈øts and Corruptions, that they return not again to entangle
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65284:33"/> thee to Folly, take the Apo≈øtles advice, <hi>be ≈øober, be vigilant, becau≈øe your Adver≈øary the Devil as a roaring Lion, walketh about ≈øeeking whom he may devour, whom re≈øi≈øt ≈øtedfa≈øt in the Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 8.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Art thou Righteous to God by Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, not by thine own works and power, be humble in the ≈øen≈øe of thy own incapacity and in≈øufficiency for any good in thy ≈øelf, and ≈øay with that holy Apo≈øtle. <hi>For I know that in me, that is in my Fle≈øh there dwelleth no good thing, for to will is pre≈øent with me, but how to perform that which is good that I know not, for the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do: for I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is pre≈øent with me. O wretched man that I am! Who ≈øhall deliver me from the Body of this death?</hi> Rom. 7.18, to 25. And be deeply ≈øen≈øible of the weakne≈øs and imperfection of all thy Graces and Attainments, as rotten Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and men≈øtruous Clouts, as in and from thee, and that in thy ≈øelf there is no ≈øoundne≈øs, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanne≈øs from the ≈øole of the Foot to the top of the head, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ch.</hi> 64.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to cen≈øoriou≈øne≈øs and ra≈øh judging the Scripture tells us, that <hi>offences mu≈øt come, but wo to them by whom they come,</hi> Luke 17.1. And as none are more obnoxious to be ≈ølandered, reviled and evil reported of, and be treated cen≈øoriou≈øly, and uncharitably than the Godly, this they may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for their Comfort and Patience, that the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple mu≈øt not expect better entertainment than his Ma≈øter, nor the Servant than his Lord, and as Chri≈øt was reviled with being a friend to Publicans and Sinners, a Wine-bibber and a Drunkard, and that he did ca≈øt out Devils by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.32, 33, 34. So may the Children of God contentedly ≈øit down under the uncharitable con≈øtructions of the Enemies of Truth, after the

            <p>The ≈øecond branch of Chri≈øts Mediatory Office, is to be a Prie≈øt, and the Office of a Prie≈øt being to offer up Sacrifice for Sinners, we ≈øhall con≈øider how this agreeth to Chri≈øt, and is performed by him, the holy Apo≈øtle tells us, <hi>That he that de≈øireth the Office of a Bi≈øhop or Teacher, de≈øireth a good work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1. And he al≈øo tells us that it is ≈øo honourable and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, <hi>that no man taketh it to him≈øelf, but he that is called thereunto as was Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5.4.</p>
            <p>And therefore God in di≈øplea≈øure with <hi>Uzziah</hi> the great King of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> for intruding into the Prie≈øts Office ≈øtruck him with Lepro≈øy to his death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18. to end. But none can claim better or ≈øo good a Title to the Prie≈øthood, as our great high Prie≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who took not that honour to him≈øelf, but it was given to him of his Father, who ≈øaid to him, <hi>this day have I begotten thee, and thou art a Prie≈øt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchi≈øedeck, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 110.4. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 7.13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>And although he was <hi>Heir of all things, and by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65284:39"/> whom the World was made, and being the brightne≈øs of the Fathers glory, and expre≈øs Image of his per≈øon, he was annointed with the Oil of Gladne≈øs above his Fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.2, 3, 9. And made the High Prie≈øt, by the Council of Heaven, for Mans Eternal Salvation, and as he had this his call, immediately from Heaven, ≈øo he hath it, with more tran≈øcendent eminency than other Prie≈øts, in many con≈øiderations.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that all Prie≈øts taken from among≈øt Men, are compa≈ø≈øed about with Infirmities and Sins, and as in compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to others, ≈øo al≈øo for their own as well as for the ≈øins of others, they are to offer up Sacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.23, 28. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.7. but this our great High Prie≈øt though in Compa≈ø≈øion to us, he took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, <hi>and was ≈øubject to natural Infirmities, and in the Fle≈øh was tempted with like Infirmities, to ≈øuccour ≈øuch as were tempted, yet without ≈øin,</hi> Heb. 2.16, 17, 18. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.15. However he is e≈ø≈øentially holy, <hi>for ≈øuch an High Prie≈øt became us, who is holy, harmle≈øs, undefiled, ≈øeparate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens, who needeth not daily, as the≈øe High Prie≈øts, to offer up Sacrifice, fir≈øt for his own Sins, and then for the People, for this he did, once when he offered up him≈øelf,</hi> Heb. 7.26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All other Prie≈øts are made without an Oath, but he with an Oath, <hi>for tho≈øe Prie≈øts were made without an Oath, but this with an Oath, by him that ≈øaid to him, the Lord Swore and will not Repent, thou art a Prie≈øt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchi≈øedeck, <hi>and hath an unchangeable Prie≈øthood,</hi> Hebrews 7.21, 24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Other Prie≈øts are for a time, his Prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is for ever, and unchangeable, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Scripture, <hi>They were many Prie≈øts, and not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue, becau≈øe of death, but this man, becau≈øe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prie≈øthood,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65284:40"/> wherefore he is able al≈øo to ≈øave them to the uttermo≈øt, that come unto God by him, ≈øeeing he ever liveth to make Interce≈ø≈øion for them, for the Law maketh High Prie≈øts which have Infirmities, but the word of the Oath which was ≈øince the Law, maketh his Son, who is con≈øecrated for evermore; for Chri≈øt is not entered into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ≈øelf, now to appear in the Pre≈øence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. Heb. 7.23, 24, 25, 28. And by the Holy Apo≈øtle <hi>John, If any man ≈øin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Righteous,</hi> 1 John 2.1.</p>
            <p>From the≈øe Scriptures we have a clear proof of this con≈øolatory Doctrine, that Chri≈øts Prie≈øthood continueth when mens cea≈øe, for his is Eternal, theirs are but while they are on Earth; but on the other Hand, Chri≈øt hath entered into the Heavens to make Interce≈ø≈øion for us, and although he hath once for all, fulfilled the Sacrifice to Ju≈øtice for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, neverthele≈øs he is ≈øtill at a po≈øt of Interce≈ø≈øion in Heaven, with the Father, to make our reque≈øts known, and to procure the an≈øwer to our Petitions; and as at his leaving of the World, he told his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he was going to the Father, and told them <hi>What≈øoever ye ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son, and if ye ask anything in my name I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14.13, 14.</p>
            <p>It clearly appears his Mediatory Office is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but continueth, and will continue until the re≈øtitution of all things, and he give up the Kingdom to his Father.</p>
            <p>As this Doctrine affords great con≈øolation to all Believers, that in all their wants Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, while in their Pilgrim ≈øtate, they are a≈ø≈øured of an Advocate to make Interce≈ø≈øion for them, ≈øo we have a clear confutation of that errour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ≈øet up the Doctrine of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65284:40"/> and Interce≈ø≈øion of Saints, which exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derogates from the Prerogative of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who is that great High Prie≈øt and only Mediator for Sinners; for the Apo≈øtle is mo≈øt po≈øitively clear, that Prie≈øts among≈øt men are not ≈øuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue becau≈øe of Death, but this man continueth for ever, ≈øo as nothing can be clearer than that their Office determines with their Lives, and his continueth in Heaven, making Interce≈ø≈øion for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>What can be a greater contradiction of Scripture, and more derogatory to the ≈øole Prerogative of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øts Mediation, than to allow the power of Interce≈ø≈øion to any Saint or Angel, who≈øe Office is extingui≈øhed when they yield up the Gho≈øt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Prie≈øts among≈øt Men, offer Sacrifices of corruptible things at the charge of others, but this great High Prie≈øt hath made a Sacrifice of his own blood for the ≈øins of others. <hi>But Chri≈øt being come an High Prie≈øt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ≈øay, neither by the blood of Goates and Calves, but by his own blood, he entred in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us, for if the blood of Bulls, and Goates, and of the A≈øhes of an Heifer, ≈øprinkling the Unclean, ≈øanctifieth to the purifying of the Fle≈øh, how much more ≈øhall the blood of Chri≈øt, who through the Eternal Spirit, offered him≈øelf, without ≈øpot to God, purge your Con≈øciences to ≈øerve the living God?</hi> Heb. 9.11, 12, 13, 14. and el≈øewhere, <hi>Looking for the ble≈ø≈øed hope, and the glorious appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who gave him≈øelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to him≈øelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.13, 14. <hi>Who gave him≈øelf for our ≈øins, that he might deliver us from this pre≈øent evil World, according to the Will of God and our Father,</hi> Gal. 1.4. <hi>being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65284:41"/> ju≈øtified freely by his Grace, by the Redemption that is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, whom God hath ≈øet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his righteou≈øne≈øs, for the Remi≈ø≈øion of Sins that are pa≈øt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God; to declare at this time his Righteou≈øne≈øs that he might be ju≈øt, and the ju≈øtifier of him which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Je≈øus, where is boa≈øting then? it is excluded, by what Law? of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith, therefore we conclude, that a Man is ju≈øtified by Faith, without thee deeds of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.24, to 29.</p>
            <p>Hence then have we this great Doctrine of Chri≈øts ≈øatisfaction for Believers, plainly di≈øcovered and proved unto us, in which we ≈øee the contrivance of Heaven for Mans Eternal Redemption; <hi>(freely ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)</hi> that is without merit or reward on our part, but of Bounty and Grace, <hi>(whom God hath ≈øet forth)</hi> by the joint Council of the Godhead (through Chri≈øt Je≈øus;) here the Sole Mediatory office lodged in him <hi>(through Faith in his blood;)</hi> this is the duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on Believers part <hi>(for remi≈ø≈øion of Sins that are pa≈øt;)</hi> this is the full ≈øatisfaction to Ju≈øtice, <hi>(through the forbearance of God)</hi> the con≈øent of Heaven and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity for Sinners <hi>(that he might be ju≈øt)</hi> that Ju≈øtice might be ≈øatisfied and ≈øin expiated by the Blood of Je≈øus (and <hi>the Ju≈øtifier of him that believeth in Je≈øus)</hi> that Chri≈øts Blood be imputed as ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sin, without farther ≈øatisfaction from Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or other Mediators.</p>
            <p>From all which, and almo≈øt in expre≈øs words, we have the confutation of that impious Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz. of <hi>Merit, Mediation</hi> of <hi>Saints, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory after Death,</hi> all ≈øins being done away by the Blood of Je≈øus, God being the ju≈øtifier of him that believeth in Je≈øus, what room then is there for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory?</p>
            <p>Another difference between our great High Prie≈øt and Prie≈øts on Earth is that they offered often, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65284:41"/> he offered up him≈øelf once for all, a Propitiation for Sin, and thereby at once ≈øatisfied Ju≈øtice as in the foregoing and other Scriptures, <hi>By the which Will we are ≈øanctified through the offering of the Body of Je≈øus once for all, and every Prie≈øt ≈øtandeth daily mini≈øtring, and oftentimes offering the ≈øame ≈øacrifices, which can never take away Sin, but this Man after he had offered one Sacrifice for ≈øin, for ever ≈øate down on the Right Hand of God, for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ≈øanctified,</hi> Heb. 9.11, 12. <hi>He entred in once into the holy Place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 10.11, 12, 14.</p>
            <p>From this plain Doctrine of Chri≈øts once offering him≈øelf a Sacrifice for Sinners, believers may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them≈øelves in a≈ø≈øurance of Salvation from that Sacrifice of his Blood, <hi>and may come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>And may have a ≈øtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ≈øet before us, which hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul, both ≈øure and ≈øtedfa≈øt, and which entreth into that within the Vail, whether the forerunner is for us entred, even Je≈øus made an High Prie≈øt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchi≈øedeck, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine al≈øo plainly reproves that Judaick Idolatrous and vain opinion of the Popi≈øh Ma≈øs, in crucifying a fre≈øh the Lord of Glory, and ≈øo often as their ≈øuper≈øtitious fopperies lead them to it, not remembring, or wilfully not believing, that Chri≈øt entered once for all within the Vail, and that their ≈øuper≈øtitious wor≈øhip, is the old yoak which neither the Jews nor their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>athers could bear, <hi>and was a Figure for the time then pre≈øent, and could not make him that did the Sacrifice perfect, as pertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and onely i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>po≈øed until the time of Reformation; but Chri≈øt coming an High Prie≈øt of good things to come, and by his own blood entered once into the holy place, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65284:42"/> obtained eternal redemption for us, and thereby aboli≈øhed the ≈øhadow of Sacrifices,</hi> Heb. 9.9, 10, 11, 12. By his own final Sacrifice, ≈øo as the Body being come, we ≈øhould ≈øtay no more on the ≈øhadow.</p>
            <p>The third branch of Chri≈øts Mediatory Office for Believers <hi>is to be their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The honour, wealth, and ≈øafety of a Nation and People, do commonly depend on the good or bad qualification of their Kings, Rulers, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and we ≈øee in all Hi≈øtories that the Pro≈øperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happine≈øs of a people hath been according to the Vertue, or Genious of their Princes, Rulers, and Governours, and we find in Scripture it is a Cur≈øe to a Nation, when Children are ≈øet over them, <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 10.16. and the Church complains as her greate≈øt afflictions, <hi>Servants have ruled over us, and Princes are hanged up by the hands, the faces of Elders were not honoured,</hi> Lam. 5.8, 12. And that this of having Childi≈øh Governours, not endowed with ≈øuitable faculties of governing, is a great Judgment on a Nation, experience tells us, for that thereby all the Fountains of Ju≈øtice are corrupted, and men either do that which is right in their own Eyes, as when there was no King in <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> or a King not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or ≈øufficiently qualified for Government, or the Judges and Inferiour Governours are culled out of Favorites, or men of di≈øpo≈øition with the unqualified Governour, and thus as a Judgment for the ≈øins of King and People, Ju≈øtice which is the only pre≈øervative of the Body Politick is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>The wicked walk on every ≈øide when the vile≈øt Men are exalted,</hi> P≈øal. 12.6. and according to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Judgment is turned away backward, and Ju≈øtice ≈øtandeth afar off, for Truth is fallen in the Street, and Equity cannot enter, yea Truth faileth, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from Evil maketh him≈øelf a Prey,</hi> I≈øa. 59.9, to 16.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65284:42"/>
            <p>And as the folly of Princes, corruption of Judges, Interruption, Decay, or wre≈øting of Ju≈øtice, is one of the greate≈øt Judgments on a People or Nation, ≈øo on the other hand, It is one of the greate≈øt Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings that can attend a People or Nation, when their King, Governours, or Rulers, are of the Wi≈øe, Ju≈øt, and Prudent; <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed art thou O, Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes Eat in due ≈øea≈øon, for ≈øtrength, and not for drunkenne≈øs,</hi> Eccle≈ø. 10.17.

            <p>Fir≈øt, By ≈øhewing his free pardon of all their tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øions and ≈øins, by a full and general act of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, entered into the Records of Heaven, by the Blood of Je≈øus. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions for mine own ≈øake and will not remember thy ≈øins,</hi> I≈øa. 43.25. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick Cloud thy tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, and as a Cloud thy ≈øins, return unto me for I have redeemed thee,</hi> I≈øa. 44.22. And that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous record of free love, bounty, and ab≈øolution from ≈øin: <hi>And you being dead in your ≈øins, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumci≈øion of your fle≈øh, hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven all tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, blotting out the hand writing of Ordinances, that was again≈øt us and contrary to us, and took it away nailing it to his Cro≈øs,</hi> Col. 2.13, 14. And not only by the pardon of Sin, and thereby delivering from wrath to come, and eternal mi≈øery: But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, By rai≈øing lo≈øt man from the mi≈øerable ≈øtate by Nature and Sin, <hi>Ez.</hi> 16. To the highe≈øt pitch of honour, glory, and eternal happine≈øs, in making them Heirs of eternal Life, and joynt heirs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65284:44"/> with Chri≈øt in Glory, <hi>as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13. <hi>and if Children, then Heirs and Joint Heirs with Chri≈øt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>And the glory which thou gave≈øt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> Joh. 17.22.</p>
            <p>What greater bounty can there be, and what higher love can be expre≈ø≈øed, or can be equalled to that of Chri≈øt to Believers. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a Man lay down his life for his friend, but God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ≈øinners, Chri≈øt died for us.</hi> Rom. 5.6. to 11. All which is more particularly in≈øi≈øted on in the Doctrine of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thus when we ≈øee what a happy ≈øtate is that of a Chri≈øtian, who can find them≈øelves within that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting and ≈øure Covenant of Peace, and Eternal Happine≈øs with Chri≈øt, who is that infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach his People, and lead them in the way wherein they cannot err, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 35.8. and that merciful High Prie≈øt, who hath offered him≈øelf once for all a Sacrifice for Believers, and is able to ≈øave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, and is that only Potentate and bountiful Prince, rewards the Faith and Obedience of his People with Eternal glory, from whence may be the≈øe clear u≈øes, and inferences of con≈øolation to all ≈øuch as believe in Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Is Je≈øus Chri≈øt that infallible Prophet, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, <hi>John.</hi> 14.6. to lead and in≈øtruct his people.</p>
            <p>Is he wi≈ødom him≈øelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. and all things are revealed unto him of the Father? Is the Spirit given to him to bring glad tydings to his People, even to the Pri≈øoners of Hope? <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. doth he in≈øtruct and give Wi≈ødom, and Knowledge to all that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. Then what per≈øon can be ≈øo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in any of the matters of God, or between God
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65284:45"/> and their own Souls, but here they may have a promi≈øe of ≈øupply, he who to Believers is all and in all, is to them in the darke≈øt circum≈øtances their God, and they are commanded to tru≈øt to him, <hi>who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, and walketh in darkne≈øs and hath no light, let him tru≈øt in the name of the Lord, and ≈øtay upon his God,</hi> I≈øa. 50.10. <hi>And he is to them Wi≈ødom, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is Chri≈øt that glorious High Prie≈øt, who once for all, by his own blood hath entered into the holy place, and obtained eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ≈øinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12. what rea≈øon is there for di≈øquietude or doubting, ≈øeeing he hath ≈øacrificed him≈øelf for Believers, even though the black Cloud of their Iniquities be as crim≈øon and ≈øcarlet, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.18. and though they may under temptation with <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>I≈ørael</hi> ≈øay, <hi>their way is hid from God, and my Judgment is pa≈ø≈øed over from my God,</hi> I≈øa. 40.26, 27, 28. to end, <hi>yet in him they ought to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in this, that the everla≈øting God, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary, there is no ≈øearching of his under≈øtanding, he giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increa≈øeth ≈øtrength,</hi> I≈øa. 40.28, 29, 30, 31. And ≈øhould under the Apo≈øtles con≈øideration, <hi>That we have not an High-Prie≈øt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, without ≈øin, comply with his exhortation, let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.15, 16.</p>
            <p>And with the ≈øame Apo≈øtle, triumph in a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation, to them which are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who walk not after the fle≈øh but after the Spirit, who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65284:45"/> Elect? It is God that ju≈øtifieth, who is he that ≈øhall condemn? It is Chri≈øt that died yea rather that is ri≈øen again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, making interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi> Rom. 8.1, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is Chri≈øt Je≈øus that triumphant, and glorious Champion, <hi>With dyed Garments from</hi> Bozrah, <hi>having trode the Wine-pre≈øs of his Fathers wrath alone, for ≈øinners,</hi> I≈øa. 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Who hath conquered over Hell and Death for ≈øinners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54, 55, 56, 57. Why ≈øhould a Believer be afraid and doubtful of his Eternal Salvation in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, con≈øidering he hath his Promi≈øe for it who cannot lye. <hi>I even I am he, that comforteth thee, who art thou, that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt be afraid of a Man that ≈øhall die, and of the Son of Man, that ≈øhall be made as Gra≈øs? and forgetteth the Lord thy Maker, that hath ≈øtretched forth the Heavens, and ha≈øt feared continually every day, becau≈øe of the fury of the Oppre≈ø≈øour, as if he were ready to de≈øtroy, and where is the fury of the Oppre≈ø≈øour,</hi> I≈øa. 51.12, 13. This one Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Faith in exerci≈øe, is ≈øufficient to ≈øtay the Soul again≈øt all di≈øcouragements and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is Chri≈øt that <hi>brightne≈øs of the Fathers Glory, and expre≈øs Image of his Per≈øon who≈øe Throne is for ever,</hi> Heb. 1.3, 8. Hath he dignified man, and aba≈øed him≈øelf, in taking Mans Nature upon him, and not the Nature of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. Art thou among≈øt men, O Chri≈øtian contemptible, as a Worm, and no Man: looked upon as the abject and of ≈øcouring of the Earth as was Chri≈øt? <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 22. Why art thou ca≈øt down and di≈øquieted, is not Chri≈øt thy Elde≈øt Brother, hath he taken thy Nature on him for any other end than for thy comfort? <hi>For that he him≈øelf hath ≈øuffered, being tempted he is able to ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are tempted.</hi> Heb. 2.18. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Condition in the World be never ≈øo de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, lay thou hold on Chri≈øt as thy Sacrifice, be

            <p>Fifthly, Is Chri≈øt thy King, who hath the Keys of Hell and Death, who can bind and no man loo≈øe, and loo≈øe and no man bind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. What Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, Confinement, Re≈øtraint, or Power can keep thee out of his Hands, when his appointed time cometh, <hi>That he will ≈øend his word and heal and loo≈øe thee?</hi> P≈øalm 107.16, 20. Rom. 8.35, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Is Chri≈øt that bountiful Prince, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gifts to Men, hath he aba≈øed him≈øelf to Death to make thee a King, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. art thou in Poverty with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and in thy own ≈øen≈øe, and humane appearance thy way is hid from God as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going place, neverthele≈øs, remember his power and bounty, <hi>He ≈øetteth the poor on high, and maketh them families like a Flock, the righteous ≈øhall ≈øee it and rejoice,</hi> P≈øalm 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>7.41, 42. Yea remember his Promi≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be comforted in it, <hi>I will give thee the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures of darkne≈øs and hidden riches of ≈øecret places,</hi> I≈øa: 45.3. <hi>Prove me now ≈øaith the Lord, if I will not open thee the Windows of Heaven, and pour you out a ble≈ø≈øing that there ≈øhall not be room enough to receive it,</hi> Mal. 3.10.

            <p>We have ≈øeen in the foregoing di≈øcour≈øe, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of man in his fir≈øt Creation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65284:46"/> his unhappy and mi≈øerable e≈øtate by rea≈øon of ≈øin, and al≈øo, and immediately preceeding this di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, the Lords great clemency and free bounty to Man, by the Coun≈øel of Heaven from all Eternity, in redeeming Man by a Covenant of free Love in Je≈øus Chri≈øt according to that Scripture, <hi>O</hi> I≈ørael <hi>thou ha≈øt de≈øtroyed thy ≈øelf but in me is thy help,</hi> Ho≈øea 13. and 9. And as this great Salvation is by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, wherein he both undertakes for Man, and procures Mercies to Man, ≈øo there are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incumbent to man on his part of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Although Man by his fir≈øt and original ≈øin, as hath been already ≈øhewn, hath di≈øabled him≈øelf, that he is capable of no performance in him≈øelf, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs Je≈øus Chri≈øt his ≈øurety undertakes for him, and he works and accompli≈øheth all the≈øe works in him.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Conditions on Mans part are variou≈øly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed in Scripture, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> under the Law, tells the People of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> their duty towards God. <hi>And now O</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ≈øerve the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I command thee for thy good,</hi> Deut. 10.22, 23. The holy Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> much to the ≈øame purpo≈øe, <hi>he hath ≈øhewed thee, O Man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do ju≈øtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Mic. 6.8.</p>
            <p>The duty of Chri≈øtians under the Go≈øpel, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Law are morally the ≈øame, the holy Apo≈øtle gives us in divers places the account of our duties under the Go≈øpel. <hi>Let us clean≈øe our ≈øelves from all filthine≈øs of the Fle≈øh, and of the Spirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holine≈øs in the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. And the ≈øame Apo≈øtle el≈øewhere, <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65284:47"/> us, that denying ungodline≈øs and worldly lu≈øts, we ≈øhould live ≈øoberly, righteou≈øly, and godly in this pre≈øent World,</hi> Titus 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>The≈øe foregoing and other Scriptures, as well in the old, as new Te≈øtament, hold out to us, the material and ≈øub≈øtantial part of our duties, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the new Covenant on mans part; although grace and ≈øalvation, comes freely unto us, by the forbearance of God, and free love of Je≈øus Chri≈øt as is already ≈øhewen, neverthele≈øs, it is but rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ju≈øt, that ≈øuch precious mercies ≈øhould be an≈øwered, with conditions on Mans part, and the rather, for that: Man hath neither ≈øtrength, power, nor capacity in him≈øelf to perform. But that as the Covenant is free, ≈øo grace to perform is freely given and obtained by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. and all the performances of Chri≈øtians, though never ≈øo exact, are but the returning to God what we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him and though we may better our ≈øelves by the≈øe performances, and thereby render our ≈øelves more acceptable to God, neverthele≈øs we do not at all profit God thereby, for what we can do to God in our Service and Wor≈øhip is but our Duty, and brings him no advantage, according to Chri≈øts own Doctrine. <hi>When ye ≈øhall have done all the≈øe things which are commanded you, ≈øay, we are uprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which was our duty to do,</hi> Luke 17.10.</p>
            <p>As the holy Scriptures of the old and new te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hold out to us the whole complex of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian duties, which being ≈øo various, and collected from ≈øo many ≈øeveral Scriptures, and for the better attaining to the knowledge thereof, are to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in order, under the ≈øeveral heads of the duties of the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Table, ≈øhall by the ble≈ø≈øing of God be the ≈øubject of the en≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to examine the particular duties
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65284:47"/> of Chri≈øtians under this new Covenant, we ≈øhall by the way con≈øider the great difference between the bounty and goodne≈øs of God to Repenting Sinners, and the bounty and goodne≈øs of man to one another, in which we ≈øhall find made good that Scripture. <hi>As the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ≈øo are my thoughts higher than your thoughts, and my ways higher than your ways,</hi> I≈øa. 55.9.</p>
            <p>We have di≈øcovered that the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt his bounty is ≈øuch, that man by ≈øin again≈øt God, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forfeited his fir≈øt and happy e≈øtate in Paradi≈øe, and being therefore accur≈øed and concluded under wrath, is freely re≈øtored by the Sacrifice of Chri≈øts Blood, and that all required of him in return of ≈øuch mercies; is the due ob≈øervance of Gods Commands in new obedience; and that towards mans perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, makes with him an everla≈øting Covenant, that he is their God and they his People, <hi>That he will give them one Heart, and one Way, that they may fear him for ever for the good of them and their Children after them,</hi> Jer. 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>and give them a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 11.19 and <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cau≈øe you to walk in my Statutes and ye ≈øhall keep my Commandments and do them,</hi> Jer. 36.27. By which we perceive that as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires duties on mans part, he affords to his people Strength and Grace to perform the duties Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which other Benefactors, neither do, nor can do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord gives power and authority to his people to call on him for a ≈øupply of ≈øuch of his Graces, as are nece≈ø≈øary for them to enable them to walk with him, Ezek. 36.37. <hi>I will yet for this be inquired of the Hou≈øe of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>to do it for them, ≈øeek and ye ≈øhall find, knock and it ≈øhall be opened,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 7.7, 8. and in that famous place, <hi>Ask me of things to come concerning my Sons, and my Daughters, and the works of my hands command ye me,</hi> I≈øa. 45.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord doth not only afford ≈øtock of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65284:48"/> Grace by his Spirit, and gives a command to call for more ≈øupply, but he al≈øo rewards the right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace with fre≈øh Grace, <hi>he will give Grace for Grace, and no good thing will he with-hold from tho≈øe that fear him. Then ≈øhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Ho≈ø. 6.3. and this is clear by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Talents, to ≈øuch as improved, more was given, and Eternal Life as a reward of their well-doing: but he that did not improve, what he had was taken from him, and he him≈øelf was thru≈øt into utter darkne≈øs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord delighteth in mercy and not in the ≈øeverity of his Ju≈øtice, and rather de≈øires ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ≈øhould repent and live, than peri≈øh under his Wrath and Ju≈øtice. <hi>Ca≈øt away all your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, whereby you have tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why will you dye O Hou≈øe of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>for I have no plea≈øure in the death of him that dieth, wherefore turn your ≈øelves and live,</hi> Ezek. 18.31, 32. <hi>As I live ≈øaith the Lord, I have no plea≈øure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye dye O Hou≈øe of</hi> I≈ørael? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.</p>
            <p>We ≈øee in all the≈øe foregoing ≈øteps, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire and zeal the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath, for the good and conver≈øion of ≈øinners, and aver≈øation to their di≈øtruction; but on the other hand, we ≈øhall find the great prejudice, oppre≈ø≈øion, and cruelty of men, again≈øt one another.</p>
            <p>For fir≈øt con≈øider any man as a benefactor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in that ca≈øe, where any man hath rai≈øed ≈øome to ≈øome degree of preferment or profit, either of meer good will or favour, and on taking a liking to him as his favourite, or for ≈øome good office done to him by another, makes him ≈øome grant to him≈øelf and his heirs, how frequently doth it happen that either the donor loo≈øeth his fancy or forgets
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65284:48"/> the good office to the donec in his own time? or like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Po≈øterity of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> and thereby re≈øts not till by ≈øome means or other, he brings his favourite into di≈øgrace, and worms from him the grant with Ignominy, and leaves him in wor≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than he found him, or makes him the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Butt of his di≈øplea≈øure, and expo≈øeth him to the contempt of others, or if any condition be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable on the grant, makes the Grantee unea≈øy, and never at quiet until the grant be voided.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If on the account of Charity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cour≈øe of dealing, one Neighbour or Friend happen on ≈øome pinching exigent, to ≈øupply the want of another, how frequently doth Pride upbraid the nece≈ø≈øitous, and covetou≈øne≈øs take the≈øe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that what was lent is called and forced back, ≈øo un≈øea≈øonably and in ≈øuch rigid and hard terms, that the calling the thing back after ≈øuch manner, is a greater prejudice, than the ≈øupply could be a ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and many are ruined on pretence of friend≈øhip in lending, when the event is pernicious, and the de≈øign appears to have been nothing but covetou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; let ≈øuch per≈øons con≈øider the common duty of Charity, of lending without expectation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, according to Chri≈øts Doctrine, <hi>Love ye your Enemies, and do good for evil, and lend hoping for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again, and your reward ≈øhall be great, and ye ≈øhall be the Children of the highe≈øt, for he is kind to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, and to the evil, be ye therefore merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.34, 35, 36. It were advi≈øable ≈øuch per≈øons would con≈øider, it's only Gods bounty, which makes one man in a worldly ≈øtate to differ from another, <hi>What ha≈øt thou O man, that thou ha≈øt not received? Every Good and every Perfect Gift cometh from the Father of Light,</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong, but God rai≈øeth up one and ca≈øteth down another.</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65284:49"/> Let man in pro≈øperity con≈øider, it is only by the favour of God he ≈øtandeth, <hi>and he that thinketh he ≈øtandeth let him take heed lea≈øt he fall.</hi> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>When thou Lord rebuke≈øt man for Iniquity, how do≈øt thou make his beauty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume like a Mothe?</hi> Let him con≈øider the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luke 16.19. to the end, and the rich Husbandman in the Go≈øpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16, to 22.

            <p>Let ≈øuch men remember they are of the ≈øame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and extraction with the poore≈øt, that they owe their Life, Being, and what they have to God, and are eternally lo≈øt, unle≈øs reconciled to God in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and that all men by Nature are under Wrath, and Debtors to Gods Ju≈øtice, and if he ≈øhould prove a rigorous exactor who could ≈øtand before him? therefore they ought equally to have compa≈ø≈øion on their Brethren. <hi>Remember them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them which ≈øuffer adver≈øity, as being your ≈øelves in the Body,</hi> Hebrews 13.3.</p>
            <p>Let ≈øuch remember the Parable of that cruel ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who≈øe Lord forgave to him his debt, but he dealing cruelly with his fellow Servant, his Lord fell on him, and made him irrecoverably mi≈øerable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23. to end; and the≈øe are Chri≈øts own words, <hi>≈øo likewi≈øe ≈øhall my Heavenly Father do al≈øo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes,</hi> Mat. 18.35.</p>
            <p>It being ≈øo known a Truth, and fatal to Mankind, that all Men in <hi>Adam</hi> were concluded under Sin and Wrath, and that woful experience as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach us. That all men (except Chri≈øt) are frequently defiled with actual Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions; And that no man acquainted with him≈øelf can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this truth, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Eecle≈ø.</hi> 7.20,</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65284:49"/>
            <p>And that as all men in <hi>Adam</hi> are under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Wrath and Ju≈øtice, ≈øo the only way of Salvation is by Faith in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>Romans.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
            <p>Now that all naturally are under the ≈øtate of Sin, let us con≈øider the duties incumbent for our recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of this condition, and the≈øe are chiefly five. Fir≈øt, Trace Man what he is in his E≈øtate of Nature. Secondly, Let us ≈øet Original Sin before us as a Beacon. Thirdly, Study Mortification. Fourthly, Study Repentance. Fifthly, Search into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes of God and believe them.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Duty is to trace Man from his beginning, of whom if we take a view, we will find him ≈øoon after his Creation to fall from his Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, by breaking the command and eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>And the Lord ≈øaw that the wickedne≈øs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Heart was evil and only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5, 7. And ≈øee how he is de≈øcribed by the Prophet. <hi>The Heart of Man is deceitful and de≈øperately wicked above all things, who can know it,</hi> Jeremiah 17.9.</p>
            <p>See how Man is painted out in his natural defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thy Father was an Amorite, and thy Mother a Hittite as for thy Nativity, in the day that thou wa≈øt born, thy Navel was not cut, neither wa≈øt thou wa≈øhed in Water to ≈øupple thee, thou wa≈øt not wa≈øhed at all, nor ≈øalted at all, no Eye pittied thee, to do any of the≈øe things to thee, to have compa≈ø≈øion on thee, but thou wa≈øt ca≈øt out on the open fields to the loathing of thy per≈øon, in the day thou wa≈øt born,</hi> Ezek. 16.3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See more of this under the head of original ≈øin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, all our unrighteou≈øne≈ø≈øes are as filthy-Rags, we do all fade away as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like a Wind have taken us away,</hi> I≈øa. 64.6.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65284:50"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold I was ≈øhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me,</hi> P≈øal. 51.5.</p>
            <p>He is accur≈øed of God, for as many as are under the Law are under the Cur≈øe, <hi>For it is written, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed is every Man which continueth not in every thing which is written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Deut. 27.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Set Original Sin as a Beacon before us, The u≈øe of a Beacon is to take directions how to ≈øteer a right Cour≈øe, to avoid ≈øplitting on a Rock or danger, or upon Inva≈øion to avoid ≈øurprizal by Enemies, how great rea≈øon hath Man in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his lo≈øt happine≈øs by ≈øin, to avoid ≈øplitting on that Rock again? Remember <hi>Lots</hi> Wife ≈øtruck up into a Pillar of Salt, for looking back to ≈øinful <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.26. The Pa≈ø≈øover was appointed to remember the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> that the Lord by his Power had re≈øcued them from their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 13.3. The Prophet <hi>Ho≈øea</hi> in 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. chapters of his Prophecies holds forth to us the natural and rebellious frame of Mans Spirit, which we ≈øhould always have under our Eyes.</p>
            <p>The third Duty incumbent is Mortification of all ≈øins and corruptions, actual and habitual, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quality or degree. And that</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, by applying our ≈øelves to Chri≈øt by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Wa≈øh me and I ≈øhall be clean, purge me and I ≈øhall be whiter than Snow; create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> I≈øa. 51.7, 10. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally defiled mu≈øt be clean≈øed by him, <hi>For he is made to us Wi≈ødom, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. of this more at large hereafter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Get a ≈øelf loathing for ≈øin, <hi>we are all as an unclean thing, from the ≈øole of the foot to the top of the head,</hi> and with holy <hi>Job</hi> abhor thy ≈øelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65284:50"/> in Du≈øt and A≈øhes, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>ch.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Job</hi> 42.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Get deep apprehen≈øions of the Infinite and free love of God in Chri≈øt. And that fir≈øt in his early Mercy of Mans Redemption, and Promi≈øe after Mans Fall, <hi>it ≈øhall brui≈øe thy head and thou ≈øhalt brui≈øe his heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. And admire his infinite goodne≈øs of free Mercy <hi>When we were without ≈øtrength, Chri≈øt in due time died for the ungodly. God ≈øo loved the World, that while we were yet Sinners and Enemies, Chri≈øt died for us,</hi> Rom. 8.5, 6, 9. This is that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi> which was promi≈øed for Redemption of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>ch.</hi> 11.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 53. all.</p>
            <p>The fourth Duty is Repentance, which is a Godly ≈øorrow for ≈øin not to be repented of, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apo≈øtles de≈øcription hath the≈øe ≈øeven qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Carefulne≈øs,</hi> which is an Impartial di≈øcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ≈øearching into all the Thoughts and Actions, concealing none, nor conniving at any thing of Sin, though as dear as right Eye, or right Hand, <hi>If thy right Hand offend cut it off, if the right Eye offend pull it out, it is profitable that one member peri≈øh rather than the whole Body. He that loveth Father, Brother, or Child, better than me, is not worthy of me, he that lo≈øeth his Life ≈øhall find it, and, he that ≈øaveth his Life ≈øhall loo≈øe it, and he that taketh not up his Cro≈øs, and followeth not me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 5.29, 30. Mark 9.44.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Clearing your ≈øelves.</hi> That is, not only to part with what Lu≈øts we plea≈øe, and confe≈ø≈øing what ≈øins we are indifferent to part with, but ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning our ≈øelves according to the ballance of the Sanctuary, <hi>To the Law and to the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> not by the level of affection and intere≈øt, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p>A Third is <hi>Indignation,</hi> To hate every ≈øin with an implacable prejudice, even to hearing, ≈øeeing, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65284:51"/> handling, or any ≈øort of communication or delight in ≈øin, with an abhorence as infectious; can any touch Pitch and not be defiled? with aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion as an infectious Plague, jealous as of the Wiles of the Devil, as Intanglements and Fetters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Zeal;</hi> With great anxiety, after a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough di≈øcovery of every ≈øin in its blacke≈øt dre≈øs, in its Nature, Root, Branches and Tendencies, zeal for full purging, and wa≈øhing, not leaving Root or Branch of any Sin unmortified or ≈øubdued; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tampering or li≈øtning to new affinities, or terms of recon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iliation, or inticements, hotly and warmly pur≈øuing every Sin, to utter death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Vehement de≈øire,</hi> Like one curious to paint to the Life. the Nature, Mon≈øtruous ≈øhape, and mi≈øchievous quality of every ≈øin, as well in its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øivene≈øs to, and dete≈øtablene≈øs with God, <hi>(who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity)</hi> as in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ne≈øs to Man, expo≈øing him to the wrath of God, and barring him from entring into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeru≈øalem, <hi>where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as the only Enemy of Mans Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happine≈øs, and bla≈øting with a Cur≈øe all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments, and the di≈øturber of the Peace of Mans Con≈øcience, in a Communion with God, and diverts him from enjoying of God, in place of Lu≈øt and Sin.</p>
            <p>The Sixth qualification, is <hi>Fear,</hi> Watching and Praying le≈øt we enter into temptation, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mindful that the ≈øubtile Enemy of our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Devil goeth about night and day, like a roaring Lion, ≈øeeking whom he may devour,</hi> And therefore in watching <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> Eph. 6.14, 15, 16. and watch over our Thoughts, Words, and Actions, having a continual Eye on the Enemy without, as a Sentry ≈øtanding in view of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65284:51"/> Camp day and night, ob≈øerving the voice of all Gods Providences and Di≈øpen≈øations, not putting the evil day far from us, but being on our watch with oyl in our Lamps, and our Lamps burning, knowing that the Bridegroom cometh as a Thief in the night, not knowing what hour he will come, and therefore to be always ready le≈øt when he comes we ≈øleep, and that the door of Mercy may not be ≈øhut on us for ever, <hi>Mat</hi> 24.14.</p>
            <p>The Seventh qualification of true Repentance, is <hi>Revenge,</hi> Holy revenge con≈øi≈øteth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es in Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus and believe them, all men are anxious to have good Titles to their E≈øtates, and to know them; how much more ought Chri≈øtians, to be ≈øolicitous for the knowledge of ≈øacred Records, to in≈øure their Intere≈øt of ≈øomething with Chri≈øt. Chri≈øts Promi≈øes to his People, are either for things Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,

            <p>Fir≈øt, The free love of God, in ≈øending Chri≈øt a Ran≈øom for Sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All ≈øuitable graces and ≈øpiritual ble≈ø≈øings, given by God to the called according to his promi≈øe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Eternal Life and Salvation given to all who believe in Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>As to the fir≈øt, Scriptures are full of the Records, of Gods free love in redeeming Man by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, when Man was in no condition to make terms for him≈øelf, and that early in≈øtance of Gods compa≈ø≈øion on Man when he had ≈øo ≈øoon fallen from his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>I will put enmity between thy Seed and her Seed, It ≈øhall brui≈øe thy head and thou ≈øhalt brui≈øe his heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. Here is a clear promi≈øe of the Me≈ø≈øiah, of victory over Sin and Satan. <hi>And when we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øtrength, in due time Chri≈øt died for us, and when we were yet ≈øinners.</hi> And that compa≈ø≈øion of God, when Man was contemptible, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, and <hi>no Eye pitied thee, to do the≈øe things to thee, and when I pa≈ø≈øed by, thy time was the time of Love, and I ≈øaid to thee live, yea I ≈øaid to thee live,</hi> And that Evangelical Invitation, <hi>Ho, every one that thir≈øteth, come to me, drink of the Waters of Life, buy wine, and milk, without money, and without price, come to me, and I will make your Souls live, and make an everla≈øting Covenant with you. Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake his wickedne≈øs, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon him,</hi> I≈øa. 55. to 8.</p>
            <p>This ≈øtrain, con≈øtant current, and Ocean of free Love, flows upon free terms, upon the mo≈øt mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and without any terms, or expectation of any return from Man, but freely without recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.

            <p>The ≈øecond thing in ≈øpiritual ble≈ø≈øings, is Gods furni≈øhing Believers with all ≈øuitable Graces, ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings, and Indowments, <hi>And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, who are called according to his purpo≈øe; for whom he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, them he al≈øo did Prede≈øtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Son, He that ≈øpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ≈øhall he not al≈øo with him freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.28, 29, 32. <hi>Eye hath not ≈øeen, neither hath Ear heard, nor hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides thee O Lord) what great things he hath laid up for tho≈øe, who wait on him,</hi> I≈øa. 64.4. <hi>Ask and it ≈øhall be given, ≈øeek and ye ≈øhall find, what≈øoever ye ask the Father in my name, believe ye have them, and they ≈øhall be given you,</hi> Mat. 7.7.</p>

            <p>The fir≈øt Con≈øideration, is that ≈øin, as it's the cau≈øe of all evil, is al≈øo the cau≈øe of affliction, no man is ≈øo in≈øen≈øible, but he finds the burthen of affliction, or ≈øhould be ≈øo irrational as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cau≈øes thereof, ≈øo that if we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the fir≈øt Cha≈øti≈øement which hapned to Man, to wit, his being ≈øhut out from Paradi≈øe, we will find the cau≈øe thereof to be his Rebellion, and Di≈øobedience to God, in eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, and as we mu≈øt acknowledge the Ju≈øtice on Gods part, ≈øo all the Scriptures all along ≈øhew Sin to be the cau≈øe of Affliction, <hi>Hear O Heavens, and hearken O Earth, for the Lord hath ≈øpoken, I have nouri≈øhed and brought forth Children, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled again≈øt me, the Ox knoweth his owner, and the A≈øs his Ma≈øters Crib, but</hi> I≈ørael <hi>doth not know, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do nor con≈øider, O ≈øinful Nation, a People loaden with Iniquity, a ≈øeed of evil doers, Children that are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65284:54"/> corrupters, they have for≈øaken the Lord, they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy One of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>to anger, they are gone away backward, why ≈øhould ye be ≈øtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more, the whole head is ≈øick, the whole Heart is faint, from the ≈øole of the foot to the top of the Head there is no ≈øoundne≈øs in it; but wounds and brui≈øes and putrifying ≈øores, they have not been clo≈øed, nor mollified with ointment; your Country is de≈øolate, your Cities are burned with Fire, your Land Strangers devour in your pre≈øence, and it is de≈øolate as overthrown by ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> I≈øa. 1.2, to 8. <hi>O Lord the hope of</hi> I≈ørael; <hi>all that for≈øake thee ≈øhall be a≈øhamed, and they that depart from thee ≈øhall be written in the du≈øt, becau≈øe they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaken thee the fountain of living Waters,</hi> Jer. 17.13. Where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorce, whom I have put away? behold for your Iniquities have you ≈øold your ≈øelves; and for your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions is your Mother put away, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 50.1.</p>
            <p>In the ≈øecond place, We ought to con≈øider that Affliction ari≈øeth not out of the Du≈øt, but directly or indirectly they are from God, is there any evil in the City that the Lord hath not done? <hi>Job.</hi> 5.6. You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I puni≈øh you, for all your <hi>Iniquities,</hi> Amos 3.2, 3, to 7. Who gave <hi>Jacob</hi> to the ≈øpoil, or <hi>I≈ørael</hi> to the Robbers, did not the Lord, he again≈øt whom we have ≈øinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to <hi>his Laws,</hi> I≈øa. 24.24. I form Light and create Darkne≈øs. I make Peace and create War, I the Lord do <hi>all the≈øe things,</hi> I≈øa. 45.7. All thy lovers have for≈øaken thee, they ≈øeek thee not, for I have wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with the wound of an Enemy, with the Cha≈øti≈øement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy Iniquities, becau≈øe thy ≈øins were increa≈øed, I have done the≈øe things unto thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65284:54"/>
            <p>The third con≈øideration, is what may be Gods purpo≈øe or intention in cha≈øti≈øing his own People, which may be re≈øolved and comprehended in the≈øe five.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To purge away their ≈øins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To invite his People to Repentance, by with-holding his Face by afflictions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To di≈øtingui≈øh between his Children and Ba≈øtards.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To fix on their Hearts, the ≈øen≈øe of the emptine≈øs of humane enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To po≈ø≈øe≈øs them of the true opinion of Chri≈øts excellency above all things el≈øe.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is to purify his People from ≈øin, <hi>wa≈øh you, make you clean, cea≈øe to do evil, learn to do well, if ye be willing and obedient, ye ≈øhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refu≈øe and rebel, ye ≈øhall be devoured by Fire, thy Silver is become dro≈øs, thy Wine mixed with Water, ah I will ea≈øe me of my Adver≈øaries, and avenge me of my Enemies, I will turn my Hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dro≈øs, and take away thy Tin,</hi> I≈øa. 1. to 26. By this therefore ≈øhall the Iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his Sin, when he taketh away all the Stones as Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtones, <hi>&amp;c. I≈øa.</hi> 27.9. I have refined thee, but not with Silver, I have <hi>cho≈øen thee in the furnace of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I≈øa. 48.10.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Branch of Gods purpo≈øe in afflicting his People, is, to call his People to him by his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his countenance from them by afflictions, either on their Per≈øons or Sub≈øtance. <hi>I will go and return to my place until they</hi> repent and ≈øeek my Face, in their afflictions they will ≈øeek me early, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 5.15. Therefore behold I will hedge up thy way with Thorns, and make a Wall that ≈øhe ≈øhall not find her Path, and ≈øhe ≈øhall follow after her Lovers and not overtake them, ≈øhe ≈øhall ≈øeek them, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65284:55"/> not find them, then ≈øhall ≈øhe ≈øay I will return to my fir≈øt Husband, for then was it better with me than now, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.6, to 10. Standing Waters ≈øtink, and Mettal not u≈øed or ≈øcoured corrupts, and as the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ømith by rubbing, filing, or fire, purifieth and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ean≈øeth his chiefe≈øt Mettal, ≈øo the Lord by cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, exerci≈øeth his People, and reclaims them from going a≈øtray from him, to carnal vanities. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 11 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The third Branch of Gods purpo≈øe of Afflictions upon his People, is to di≈øtingui≈øh between his own peculiar People, and the Wicked, which are called Ba≈øtards. And that by a fatherly re≈øtraining their extravagancies by moderate correction. <hi>Though I make a full end of all Nations whether I have ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in mea≈øure and not leave thee altogether unpuni≈øhed,</hi> Jer. 30.11. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he Cha≈øti eth, and ≈øcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth, for if ye endure cha≈øti≈øement, God dealeth with you, as with Sons, for what ≈øon is he, whom the Father Cha≈øti≈øeth not?</hi> but if ye be without cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof all are partakers, then are <hi>ye Ba≈øtards and no Children, Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. Behold happy is the Man <hi>whom God correcteth,</hi> Job 5 17.</p>
            <p>The Prodigal had never returned but for his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and Want, this is Gods chief means to reclaim his People, to hedge up their way with Thorns, <hi>I will melt them and try them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.6, 7, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>The fourth rea≈øon of Gods purpo≈øe in cha≈øti≈øing his people is to fix on their Hearts, the true belief of emptine≈øs of humane enjoyments.</p>
            <p>The Lord having a purpo≈øe to unite his People to him≈øelf, and finding their inclinations running after creature enjoyments, as cogenious with their natural Appetites, he draws them thence, not by nece≈ø≈øity, or con≈øtraint, but in choice, by his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65284:55"/> cha≈øti≈øements to fix on their ≈øen≈øes and experience the emptine≈øs of all humane enjoyments. And that by the≈øe two rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They are not our own, but given or lent to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are certain troubles, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Comforts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That Worldly and Earthly enjoyments, as well as Spiritual Mercies, are not ours, but all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, that all the enjoyments of this Life are but precarious from God, at his plea≈øure, to give and continue them with us, or us with them, is a truth, in experience without contradiction, and needs no proof, though there are Scripture proofs ≈øufficient. Naked came I into the World and naked ≈øhall I return, the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, ble≈ø≈øed be the name of the Lord, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. We brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ≈øhall carry nothing away with us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. And Chri≈øt ≈øaying to the Rich Man in the Go≈øpel, thou fool this night thy Soul ≈øhall be required of thee, then who≈øe ≈øhall all the≈øe things be that thou ha≈øt? <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Nay more, Man in his natural and intrin≈øick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is of all Creatures the mo≈øt weak impotent, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs and mi≈øerable of him≈øelf, the Bea≈øts of the Field can crawl, ≈øeek their food, ≈øupply them≈øelves, but Man is ≈øo feeble, that unle≈øs help be admini≈øtred to him at his Birth, and a long while after he mu≈øt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh.</p>
            <p>And this clearly appears from Scripture. <hi>In the day thou wa≈øt born, thou wa≈øt not wa≈øhed at all, nor ≈øwadled at all, thy navel was not cut, thou wa≈øt in thy blood ca≈øt out into the open Field, to the loathing of thy per≈øon, no Eye pittied thee, to do any of the≈øe things unto thee, and when I pa≈ø≈øed by, it was the time of love, and I ≈øaid to thee live, when thou wa≈øt in thy blood,</hi> Ezek. 16.1, to 7.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65284:56"/> This is the true and lively de≈øcription of Man in his natural ≈øtate and condition, whereby every Man hath cau≈øe of lowline≈øs of mind, and no man hath cau≈øe to boa≈øt, glory, or claim any thing of his own, but to acknowledge, that all things even in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, are given to him of God.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing whereby the Father of Life, and God of all Wi≈ødom, teacheth his people to the low e≈øteem and contempt of the World by their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to in≈øtruct them that the things of this Life are uncertain comforts, and certain troubles, and this is manife≈øt in all humane experience, in all ages, and all the train of enjoyments clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate this.</p>
            <p>If we take a view of all Worlds goods, and its excellency, as they are computed by the Apo≈øtle, <hi>The Lu≈øt of the Eye, the Lu≈øt of the Fle≈øh, and the Pride of Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16, 17. If we will branch them forth in the ≈øeveral particulars of honour, riches, health, friends, relations, and all the other pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excellencies of humane Life or Enjoyments, and examine all the pretenders to the≈øe injoyments ≈øince the World began, we ≈øhall find none who have not experienced the uncertainty of the≈øe enjoyments, and the anxiety and trouble attending the having of them; of all the Men on Earth, none could lay a greater claim to enjoyments of all kinds, than could <hi>Solomon,</hi> let us ≈øee then, what account he gives thereof. <hi>I was great and encrea≈øed</hi> more than all that went before me, and what≈øoever my Eyes de≈øir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I kept not from them, I with-held not my heart from any Joy, for my Heart rejoiced on all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then I looked on all the works my hands had wrought, and behold all was vanity, and vexation of Spirit, and <hi>there was no profit under the Sun,</hi> Eccle≈ø. 1.2. chap. 2. all.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65284:56"/>
            <p>Let us ≈øee the experience of <hi>David,</hi> a Man in great honour, and in favour with God, <hi>Thou ha≈øt made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age as nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, every Man at his be≈øt e≈øtate is altogether vanity,</hi> P≈øal. 39.5, 6. <hi>Surely every Man walketh in a vain ≈øhew, ≈øurely they are di≈øquieted in vain, he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who ≈øhall gather them.</hi> P≈øal. 62.9. <hi>Surely Men of high degree are vanity, and men of low degree are a Lye, to be laid in the Ballance they are all together lighter than vanity?</hi> P≈øal. 144.4.</p>
            <p>But this will be more palpable if we di≈ø≈øect the World or its enjoyments in its particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Honour, ≈øecondly Wealth, thirdly Friends or Relations, fourthly Health or Strength, and we ≈øhall find uncertainty of enjoyment, anxiety, and trouble attending all and every of them.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Honour, As it is only the airy applau≈øe of Men, and depends on humane and vulgar e≈øteem, how doth daily experience prove the in≈øtability thereof, all Ages ≈øee a Man in honour this day, and in di≈øgrace the next, what unea≈øine≈øs are men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ≈øupport and continue the Idol of vain glory? Do Men ≈øtick at any acts of inju≈øtice, cruelty, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or oppre≈ø≈øion, to ≈øupport their Dagon of Pride or vain glory? yea do not the≈øe Idolaters of vain glory, rather than outlive the ≈ølippery ≈øplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of this World, with <hi>Achitophel,</hi> often become their own Murderers, at once ignominiou≈øly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh their life and honour? the too many in≈øtances of this kind, and the immediate foregoing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tell us, that of all things worldly honour and glory, is the mo≈øt ≈øhadowy and fanta≈øtical folly of humane Life. <hi>Man is like to vanity, his days are like a ≈øhadow that peri≈øheth away. Man that is in honour is like the bea≈øt that peri≈øheth,</hi> P≈øalm 144.4. P≈øalm 49.12, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Riches are the ≈øecond branch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65284:57"/> enjoyments, and how uncertain they are, and what anxiety they bring upon a Man to acquire and keep them, none can pretend ignorance, who are indifferently conver≈øant in the World.</p>
            <p>See the account Chri≈øt gives thereof, <hi>That it is ea≈øier for a Camel to go thorough the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ≈øee for this the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the Fool in the Go≈øpel, Mat. 19.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 19, 20. See the Apo≈øtle Pauls account of Riches: we brought nothing into this World with us, and we ≈øhall carry nothing out of it, but they that will be rich, fall into many temptations, and a ≈ønare, and many fooli≈øh and hurtful lu≈øts, which draw Men into de≈øtruction and perdition, for the love of Money is the root of all evil, which while ≈øome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced them≈øelves thorough with many ≈øorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>The third branch of humane enjoyments is Friends or Relations, and although de≈øireable Friends and Relations, be one of the greate≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of humane Life, yet how uncertain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietful this al≈øo proves, and often the greate≈øt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, is evident; yea an injury from a ≈øtranger is comportable, when unkindne≈øs, or any ill office from a Relation, is a heart breaking affliction. <hi>For it was not</hi> an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have born it, neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify him≈øelf again≈øt me, then I could have hid my ≈øelf from him, but it was thou a man, mine equal, my guide and my acquaintance, we took ≈øweet Coun≈øel together, <hi>and walked unto the Hou≈øe of God in Company.</hi> P≈øal. 55.12, 13, 14. It was not only <hi>Shimei</hi> but <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> who were unfaithful to <hi>David,</hi> and proved his greate≈øt affliction, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5, to 13.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65284:57"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> found greater trouble from his three friends Impeachments of hypocri≈øy, and from his Wives tempting of him to cur≈øe God and dye, than from all his other trials, but this is the frequent ca≈øe of Chri≈øt and his Saints, Chri≈øt was betrayed by one of his own Di≈øciples, and <hi>Paul</hi> accu≈øed by fal≈øe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> gives ≈øufficient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat again≈øt relying on Friends or Relations. <hi>Tru≈øt not in a Friend, put no confidence</hi> in a guide, keep the Door of thy Lips, from the Wife that lieth in thy Bo≈øom, for the Son di≈øhonoureth the Father, and the Daughter ri≈øeth up again≈øt the Mother, and the Daughter in Law again≈øt the Mother in Law, and a Mans Enemies are tho≈øe of his own Hou≈øe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.5.</p>
            <p>Hence we ≈øee, how the ≈øure≈øt preten≈øions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane enjoyments, are, and prove often as the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not only fail ≈øuch as lean to them, but mo≈øt frequently ≈øplinter and gaul rather than comfort.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing of humane enjoyments, is Mans Life, Health, and Strength, and how brittle this is all men can te≈øtifie. <hi>When thou rebuke≈øt Man for his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> thou make≈øt his beauty to con≈øume <hi>like a Moth. It is appointed for all Men once to dye,</hi> and what a Load is Man to him≈øelf? obnoxious to ≈øo many vici≈ø≈øitudes, compo≈øed of ≈øuch different parts, and elements, that no man can keep a calm within him≈øelf, or can re≈øi≈øt the a≈ø≈øaults of God, and the exigence of his Lot, how many loath≈øome di≈øtempers is man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed unto, by the natural Imbecillity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution?</p>
            <p>And how irre≈øi≈øtible are the Armies which invade him, in his Mind and Body, and how frail is Man if once God frown upon him, and what defence can he make, if the Armies of the Almighty a≈ø≈øault him? what Man is he then, who can boa≈øt of any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65284:58"/> thing of his own, except Sin, Corruption, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. <hi>Therefore let not the wi≈øe man glory in his wi≈ødom, nor the ≈øtrong man in his ≈øtrength, nor the rich man in his wealth, but he that glorieth, let him glory in this, That he knoweth me who exerci≈øeth Righteou≈øne≈øs, Ju≈øtice, and Loving Kindne≈øs in the Earth, for in the≈øe things I do delight ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing de≈øigned by Chri≈øt in afflicting his People, is to make them ≈øen≈øible of his own dignity and excellency, above all created enjoyments, and that in the≈øe ≈øix re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He is of him≈øelf, and all things el≈øe from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is infinite in Power.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, Of everla≈øting Continuance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conquerour over all Enemies.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If we do duly con≈øider the value of objects, Rea≈øon and Intere≈øt will enduce the choice of the worthie≈øt; and what can bar, but we mu≈øt approve of Chri≈øt as the only choice, e≈øpecially if we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, in all and every of the≈øe his incomparable excellencies, and as to the fir≈øt Creator of all things, no Creature can hold proportion with the Creator, we mu≈øt in our choice give the preheminence to Chri≈øt, he is <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> by him and for him were all things created, and by him all things ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt, he is of him≈øelf and all things el≈øe from him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Infinite in Being, Eternal, and Infinite in Power, <hi>Who hath mea≈øured the Waters in the hollow of his hand, and metted out the Heavens with his Span, and comprehended the Du≈øt of the Earth in a Mea≈øure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, all the Nations of the Earth are as a drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ≈ømall Du≈øt

            <p>The ≈øixth rea≈øon, why God thus cha≈øti≈øeth his People, is to make them ≈øen≈øible of the different mea≈øures, by which he deals with his People in their Afflictions, and with the wicked by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, and that con≈øi≈øts in the≈øe ≈øix re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He cha≈øti≈øeth his People in love and for their good, but his Judgments on the Wicked, are to their Everla≈øting Lo≈øs and Condemnation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He unwillingly and with reluctance corrects his People, but taketh plea≈øure in his Ju≈øtice upon the Wicked.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He corrects his People in mea≈øure and moderation, but Rains down the Vials of his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure upon his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Cha≈øti≈øements of his People are but for a moment, and not to make an end of them, but the Wicked are totally cut off, without expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hope of recovery.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Godly though afflicted are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65284:72"/> by Gods pre≈øence, they have communion and fellow≈øhip with the Father and holy Trinity, but the Wicked have no hope in their end or puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Godly by their afflictions are taught to know the difference between Spiritual and Carnal enjoyments, Temporal and Eternal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Godly's Cha≈øti≈øements are for their good, although all Trials, Afflictions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are a dark Cloud. and carry a pale Face, yet when the Godly do ≈øearch out the purpo≈øe of God in this, and are de≈øirous to know his Intentions therein, they will ≈øee this to be in love, when the Godly enjoy all ≈øen≈øual plea≈øures without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, they are apt to ≈øurfeit upon Mercies, and turn lazy and forget God, as the ≈ølothful Man by luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant feeding, ea≈øe, and gluttony contracts a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, ≈øo are the be≈øt of men, apt to forget the Fountain of Mercies, and wax wanton again≈øt God, as the People of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in their quiet and plenteous enjoyments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15 <hi>ch.</hi> 17. <hi>Num.</hi> 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.

But ≈øee the I≈ø≈øue of the wicked and ungodly, they ≈øhall be like the chaff which the Wind driveth away, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord doth not afflict his People willingly, but with great reluctancy, How ≈øhall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> how ≈øhall I deliver thee <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> how ≈øhall I make thee as <hi>Adma,</hi> how ≈øhall I ≈øet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> my Heart is turned within me, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting is turned together, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a plea≈øant Child? for ≈øince I ≈øpoke again≈øt him, I remember him ≈øtill earne≈øtly, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ≈øurely have mercy upon him, ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. Repent and turn your ≈øelves from your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, ≈øo Iniquity ≈øhall not be your ruin, ca≈øt away all your tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit, for why will you dye O hou≈øe of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> for I have no plea≈øure in the death of a ≈øinner, therefore turn your ≈øelves and live. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.34, 35. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord corrects his People in mea≈øure and not in extremity as he doth the wicked, hath he ≈ømitten him as he ≈ømote tho≈øe that ≈ømote him, or is he ≈ølain according to the ≈ølaughter of them that are ≈ølain by him, in mea≈øure when it ≈øhooteth forth thou wilt debate with it, he ≈øtayeth his rough Wind in the day of his Ea≈øt-wind, <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 27.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Afflictions of the Godly, are but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65284:73"/> for a ≈øhort time, for a ≈ømall moment have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaken thee, but with great mercy will I gather thee, in a little wrath I hid my ≈øelf from thee for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with everla≈øting kindne≈øs will I have mercy upon thee, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 5, 4.7, 8. They ≈øhall go into <hi>Babilon</hi> until I deliver them, I will vi≈øit them there and re≈øtore them to this place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.22. Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work ≈øhall be rewarded, and they ≈øhall come again from the Land of the Enemy, and there is hope in thine end, and thy Children ≈øhall come again in their own border, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thus though the Lord deals ≈øeverely with his People, neverthele≈øs it is but for a time; and in moderation, and giveth them a happy delivery, and eternal re≈øt with him≈øelf in the end, but he deals otherways with his Enemies, never withdrawing his Judgments from them, until he hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed their de≈øtruction, and avenged their malice again≈øt his People, Wherefore it ≈øhall come to pa≈øs when the Lord hath performed this whole work upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> I will puni≈øh the ≈øtout-heart of the King of <hi>A≈ø≈øyria</hi> and the glory of his high looks, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 41.15, 16.</p>
            <p>I was wroth with my People, I have polluted mine Inheritance, and given them into thy hands, thou did≈øt ≈øhew them no mercy, upon the antient ha≈øt thou very heavily laid thy yoak, thou ≈øaid≈øt, I will be a Lady for ever, for that thou did≈øt not lay the≈øe things to thy Heart, neither did≈øt remember the latter end of them, therefore hear thou this, thou that art given to plea≈øure, that dwelle≈øt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øly, that ≈øaye≈øt in thy Heart, I am and none el≈øe be≈øides me, I ≈øhall not ≈øit as a Widow, neither ≈øhall I know the lo≈øs of Children, but the≈øe two things ≈øhall come to thee in a moment, in one day, the lo≈øs of Children and Widow-hood, they ≈øhall come

Therefore all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thee, ≈øhall be devoured, and all that prey upon thee, wi l I give for a prey, for I will re≈øtore health unto thee, and heal thee of thy Wounds, though I make an end of all Nations, whether I have ≈øcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee, but will correct thee in mea≈øure, and not leave thee altogether unpuni≈øhed. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.7, 11, to 18. And they ≈øhall dwell ≈øafely therein and build hou≈øes and plant vineyards yea they ≈øhall dwell with confidence, when I ≈øhall have executed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all them that de≈øpi≈øe them round about, and they ≈øhall know that I am their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.29. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.26. Thou ≈øhalt ≈øeek them, but not find them, that contended with thee, they that War again≈øt thee, ≈øhall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 41.12. The Sons of them who afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, ≈øhall come bending unto thee, and they that de≈øpi≈øed thee, ≈øhall bow them≈øelves and the ≈øoles of thy Feet, <hi>I≈øa</hi> 64.12, 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Behold I have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of thy hand the Cup of trembling, even the dregs of the Cup of my fury, thou ≈øhalt no more drink it again, but I will put it into the hands of tho≈øe that afflicted thee, which ≈øaid to thy Soul bow down, that we may go over, and thou ha≈øt laid thy Body as the ground, and as the ≈øtreet to them that went over, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 51.21, 22, 23.

            <p>Fifthly, The People of God in their afflictions have the comfortable pre≈øence of God with them, but the wicked are wrackt and torn with anxiety, and di≈øplea≈øure under Gods Judgmencs, <hi>In all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

            <p>The ≈øixth thing God intends in cha≈øti≈øing of his People, is to teach them to di≈øtingui≈øh between Spiritual and Temporal, Eternal and Temporary Mercies, this being one of the chiefe≈øt con≈øiderations, and proper for Mans direction in his choice of things, and u≈øeful for Man in his Conver≈øation, how to chu≈øe things mo≈øt de≈øireable, we ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider things Temporal, and things Spiritual and Eternal under their ≈øeveral qualities, as they are contained in holy Scriptures, the holy Evangeli≈øt St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øums up all the things of the World in the≈øe three heads, <hi>The Lu≈øt of the Eye, the Lu≈øt of the Fle≈øh, and Pride of Life.</hi> It being u≈øual and natural to all men to ≈øeek and affect the enjoyment of what ≈øeems be≈øt to them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> wherefore the great point of di≈øcretion, is to inform our Judgments what things are be≈øt, which will appear by comparing of things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ≈øeveral qualities of Temporal things, may be briefly taken up from the foregoing Scripture in the≈øe heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, All things Temporal or of this Life, are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65284:74"/> ≈øubject to changes and have no certainty or ≈øtability in them, but things Spiritual or Eternal are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All enjoyments of this Life are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and cannot make any man happy while he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, All the excellencies of Creature enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are ≈øhort of the Eternal Inheritance of the Saints, which is Chri≈øt and Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All ≈øecular or temporary enjoyments, leave a Man at his Grave, but when this Life is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then cometh the Saints Eternal re≈øt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Things of this Life are uncertain and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the great Saviour of the World, Love, and Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf, being willing to inform the World and draw them off the uncertainties of peri≈øhing things, in his great Sermon on the Mount advi≈øeth to <hi>Seek Trea≈øure in Heaven, where the Moth con≈øumeth not, nor the Thief doth purloyn,</hi> Mat. 6.19, to 34. See what account <hi>Solomon</hi> the greate≈øt, riche≈øt, and mo≈øt honourable of all Men, giveth of all humane things <hi>All his days are ≈øorrow, his travel grief, his Heart taketh no re≈øt in the Night, this al≈øo is vanity, and vexation of Spirit continually,</hi> ≈øee <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>See the uncertainty of humane things in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Adonibezech, Ahithophel, Haman, Herod</hi> and many others, ≈øee <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30, to end, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. to 24. <hi>E≈øther</hi> 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.20, to 24<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

            <p>We find in daily experience, a Man to day in Court like a green Bay Tree, and next in Di≈øgrace, Pri≈øon, or Mi≈øery. The Wicked ≈øhall peri≈øh and the Enemies of the Lord ≈øhall be as the fat of Lambs, they ≈øhall con≈øume, into Smoak ≈øhall they con≈øume away, I have ≈øeen the wicked in great power and ≈øpreading him≈øelf like a green Bay Tree yet he pa≈ø≈øed

            <p>Secondly, the enjoyments of this Life are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and cannot make happy. The foregoing truth of uncertainty, Demon≈øtrate this truth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and daily experience confirm it, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and pre≈øerving of Riches, acquiring, and re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øsne≈øs in upholding of Honour, care to pre≈øerve and recover Health, do ≈øo Cruciate and Oppre≈øs Men with ≈øuch Anxiety, that all their Labour and Travel, is Sorrow and Trouble, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 90.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And they have no Plea≈øure, much le≈øs Happine≈øs in any Enjoyment, the Rich Man in the Go≈øpel, went from Chri≈øt ≈øorrowful, for that he could not hold his Riches and have Life eternal, the Scripture tells us, <hi>we brought nothing into this World with us, and it is</hi> certain we ≈øhall carry nothing out with us, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Food and Rayment, let us be therewith content but they that will be Rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into many fooli≈øh and hurtful Lu≈øts, which drown'd Men in Di≈øtruction and Perdition, for the love of Money, is the Root of all Evil, which while ≈øome covered after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced them≈øelves through with many Sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all Humane Enjoyments are ≈øhort of Chri≈øt the Inheritance of the Saints, let us narrowly ≈øurvey with all the Advantagious Aggravations of Humane Excellency, all that can be pretended choice, good, or de≈øirable in the Creature and we ≈øhall find them, all ≈øhort to, and far exceeded by the inherent excellencies in Chri≈øt, the Lord of Glory, in the≈øe particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, for that all Created Beings have their ri≈øe and being from him, and he alone is of him≈øelf, he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65284:75"/> is the fir≈øt and the la≈øt, all things were made by him, and without him was nothing made, which was made, by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, vi≈øible or invi≈øible; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or Powers, all things were Created by him and for him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is, was, and alone ≈øub≈øi≈øts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>nd all other things were made by him, ≈øo by him do they ≈øub≈øi≈øt, in him we live, move, and have our being, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he is perfect him≈øelf, all things were made for him, and he not for them, <hi>all things were Created by him and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he excelleth all things in Antiquity, he is the Antient of Days the Fir≈øt-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>and Fir≈øt-born from the Dead, tbat in all things he might have the Preheminence,</hi> Col. 1.19.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in Wi≈ødom, he is Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf, and the Fountain of Wi≈ødom, in whom are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures of Knowledee and Wi≈ødom: <hi>If any Man lack Wi≈ødom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not,</hi> read <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 2.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, in Beauty, he is the Morning Star, <hi>the Ro≈øe of</hi> Sharon, <hi>the Image of the invi≈øible God, who is the brightne≈øs of bis Glory, and the expre≈øs Image of his Per≈øon,</hi> Heb. 1.3.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In power, he is Omnipotent, and all things el≈øe but of limited Power, <hi>he is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, in him dwelleth the fulne≈øs of the Godhead bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Col. 2.9, 15.</p>
            <p>Who hath mea≈øured the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and metted out Heaven with a Span, and comprehended the du≈øt of the Earth in a mea≈øure, who hath weighed the Earth in Scales, and the Hills

            <p>Fourthly, the fourth difference between things Temporal and Eternal is that Temporal things leave a Man at his Grave, and in this Life; but Spiritual and Eternal continue with the Saints to all Eternity, So as when this mi≈øerable Life is ended, the Saints are happy in their Death, and their Spiritual Life of ble≈ø≈øed enjoyments then begins, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the Dead which dye in the Lord, they cea≈øe from their Labour, and their works follow them<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Spiritual enjoyments are not ≈øeen or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Carnal ≈øen≈øe, but are ≈øpiritually di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and are eternal. While we look not after things that are ≈øeen, but after things which are not ≈øeen; for things which are ≈øeen, are Temporal, but things that are not ≈øeen, are eternal. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. The Kingdom of Heaven con≈øi≈øts not in Eating and Drinking, chambering and wantonne≈øs, Ryotting and Drunkenne≈øs, but in Peace and Joy of the Holy Gho≈øt. This State of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Spiritual things, is briefly comprehended under the≈øe Heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, it Commenceth when all Humane Enjoyments fail and continueth to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is incorruptible, and not ≈øubject to changes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a compleat fulne≈øs of all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, when Enjoyments of this Mortal Life leaves a Man at his Grave, after he hath experienced the uncertainty, vanity, and vexation of Spirit, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humane Enjoyments, then he enters upon the quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Eternal Happine≈øs, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65284:76"/> Scripture, all the People of God are Sealed, Marked and Secured from after danger, and made firm Pillars in the Hou≈øe of God eternally in the Heavens: hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, until we have ≈øealed the Servants of the Lord in their Fore-Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. which mark is a white Stone and in it a new Name, the Name of Chri≈øt and the City of God, which is their being renewed by the Spirit of Regeneration, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17.

There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who walk not after the fle≈øh, but after the ≈øpirit, who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that ju≈øtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who ≈øhall condemn? it is Chri≈øt that dyeth, yea, rather that is ri≈øen again, and maketh interce≈ø≈øion for us, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.1, 31, 34.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, the Lot of the Wicked, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have enjoyed their good things in this Life, like the rich glutton, they are confined to everla≈øting wrath and mi≈øery, Remember that thou in thy life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time received≈øt thy good things, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> his evil things, therefore thou art now Tormented, and he Comforted, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.20. to end.</p>
            <p>The Righteous are brought out of great Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have their Robes wa≈øhed in the Blood of the Lamb, and are Cloathed with the Righteou≈øne≈øs and Glory.</p>
            <p>The≈øe are they which came out of great Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have wa≈øhed their Robes, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves white in the Blood of the Lamb, therefore they are before the Throne of God, Day and Night to ≈øerve him in his Temple, and he that ≈øitteth on the Throne, ≈øhall dwell among≈øt them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. to 18.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65284:77"/>
            <p>And on the other hand, the wicked are Chained in everla≈øting Darkne≈øs, and tormented with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øible Torments, ≈øo that they de≈øire Death, rather than Life, if any Man Wor≈øhip the Bea≈øt and his Image, or receiveth his Mark in his Forehead or in his Hand, the ≈øame ≈øhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into the Cup of his Indignation, and ≈øhall be Tormented with Fire and Brim≈øtone in the pre≈øence of the Holy Angels, and in the pre≈øence of the Lamb, and the ≈ømoak of their Torments a≈øcendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no Re≈øt Day nor Night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. to end. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.4. to end. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.8, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this State and Inheritance of the Godly is incorruptible, and therefore not Subject to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Alterations, Ble≈ø≈øed be the God and Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> hath begotten us again into a lively Hope, by the Re≈øurrection of Je≈øus Chri≈øt from the Dead, unto an Inheritance Incorruptible and Undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re≈øerved in the Heavens for us, 1 <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

As I live ≈øaith the Lord, I de≈øire not the Death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but rather that he ≈øhould Repent and live, this being not only our Intere≈øt, but Chri≈øts Glory, how much, and chiefly ≈øhould we be concerned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is Mans mo≈øt profitable concern, all Men Level their De≈øigns and Actions, to the mo≈øt Advantageous Intere≈øt, and this of Eternal Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chri≈øts Advice is mo≈øt profitable, What hath a Man profited, if he gain the whole World? thou Fool, this Night thy Soul ≈øhall be taken from thee,

            <p>Thirdly, Cloudine≈øs and Darkne≈øs of Condition cannot do it, who is among≈øt you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walketh in Darkne≈øs, and hath no Light, let him tru≈øt in the Name of the Lord, and ≈øtay upon his God, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 50, 10.

            <p>Fourthly, No Extremity of Condition can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Love of God to his People, he brings back the Captive, he rai≈øeth the Dead Bones, and cau≈øeth them to take fle≈øh and live, he unites divided Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are at Enmity, and Cements them in Love<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for all which ≈øee, <hi>Eze.</hi> 37. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43.2, 25. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 91. all.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, The greatne≈øs of the Prize to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, ≈øhould rai≈øe our great pur≈øuit of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65284:79"/> to our Souls, the Holy Scriptures are full in the Enumeration of the many excellencies that attend that great Intere≈øt, that they are almo≈øt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and it may be well applyed to that which the Holy Prophet ≈øaith, That Eye hath not ≈øeen, Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (be≈øides thee O Lord) what good things, The Lord hath laid up for them that fear him, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 64.4. However the great Salvation of Man, may be in ≈øome mea≈øure con≈øidered under the≈øe Heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It's the re≈øtoring of lo≈øt Man from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt State of Mi≈øery, without power in him≈øelf, to a State of Happine≈øs in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, in the Day thou wa≈øt born, thy Navel was not cut, thou wa≈øt in thy Blood, no Eye pittyed thee, thou wa≈øt ca≈øt out to the loathing of thy Per≈øon, but when I pa≈ø≈øed by, it was the time of Love, I ≈øaid to thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, All in this State are intituled to, and are made Heirs of all things, and called to an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Incorruptible, as in the≈øe foregoing Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. and 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3 and 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are exempted from all manner of Evil, are happy in their Death, and God ≈øhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ≈øhall be no more Death, Sorrow, nor Crying, neither ≈øhall there be any more pain, for the former things are pa≈ø≈øed away, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. to 18. <hi>ch.</hi> 21, 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they have all Compleat Happine≈øs and Fulne≈øs of Glory, are united to God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and Crowned with his Crown of Glory, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the In≈øeparable Fellow≈øhip of Chri≈øt, Saints and Angels, according to that great Scripture, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65284:80"/> they all may be one, as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee, that they al≈øo may be one in us, the glory which thou gave≈øt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, I will that they may be with me where I am, to behold my glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. to 25. And for the Fellow≈øhip of the Saints with God, Chri≈øt Je≈øus, Angels and ju≈øt Men made perfect in the New <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> ≈øee that often repeated place, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. Thus, this great Prize ≈øhould in the Apo≈øtles Exhortation, rai≈øe our Encouragement, to ha≈øten our motion to the New <hi>Jeru≈øalem<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> where for being compa≈ø≈øed about with ≈øo great a Cloud of Witne≈ø≈øes, let us lay a≈øide every weight which hang down, and the Sin that doth ≈øo ea≈øily be≈øet us, and with patience run the Race, that is ≈øet before us, looking unto Je≈øus, the Author and Fini≈øher of our Faith, who for the glory was ≈øet before him, endured the Cro≈øs, di≈øpi≈øing the ≈øhame, and is ≈øet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God, Con≈øider him which endured ≈øuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sinners, lea≈øt ye be wearyed and faint in your Minds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>Thus as Salvation, Eternal Happine≈øs, the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and Undefiled Inheritance of all things, the in≈øeparable fellow≈øhip of the Holy Trinity, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Saints, is the undeniable Prize at the end of our Race, the Intere≈øt and valuablene≈øs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought to rai≈øe our con≈øtant, zealous, and patient pur≈øuit thereof, for which, be≈øides what hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been ≈øaid, we have the≈øe manifold and ≈øuperex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Encouragements.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, our Salvation is freely of Gods pure Love in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chri≈øt made and redeemed the World, without Mans help.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65284:80"/>
            <p>Thirdly, We have the examples and in≈øtances of Chri≈øts great humiliation and ≈øufferings on Earth.</p>
            <p>Forthly, The different and ≈øure e≈øtate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed far more excellent and ≈øure than Mans E≈øtate in his fir≈øt Creation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The great Priviledges and Excellencies of the Saints in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, God being infinite in Power, Wi≈ødom, and Holine≈øs, ab≈øolute and perfect in him≈øelf, without the help or nece≈ø≈øity of any humane Being, being to accompli≈øh his Soveraignty of him≈øelf, of his own free Will and for his Glory he made the World, and upholds it, <hi>Who is the Image of the Invi≈øible God, the fir≈øt born of every Creature, by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in the Earth, Vi≈øible and Invi≈øible, whether they be Thrones or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him and for him, and by him all things con≈øi≈øt. And to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Man, The World, and all things were freely made by Ood, ≈øo Man and the World are freely Redeemed by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. This of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, being one of the mo≈øt incomprehen≈øible my≈øteries of free love; It may be branched out thus.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That it is free, without paction or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any retribution or ≈øatisfaction, but meerly by love and good will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this Salvation is to ≈øuch who are utterly incapable of helping them≈øelves, and in ≈øuch circum≈øtances as they are in mo≈øt incapacities and di≈øadvantages.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it brings with it all means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ≈øuitable ≈øupplies.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65284:81"/>
            <p>Fouthly, That it is compleat and full, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can le≈ø≈øen the enjoyment, or bar the ≈øen≈øe of it, except ob≈øtinate wilfulne≈øs, and a refu≈øing of the offer.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Method and Way by which this great Salvation is accompli≈øhed, to wit, by Chri≈øts taking on him the humane Nature, and in the fle≈øh ≈øuffered for Mans Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions, do much heigthen the mi≈øtery of Redemption.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That the Mediator when he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated that great work, makes the Redeemed ≈øharers of his own and Fathers glory.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That this Salvation is freely of love and good will, without paction of any recompence from ≈øuch as expect and receive the benefit of it, appears from the≈øe Scriptures <hi>for all have ≈øinned and come ≈øhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23, 24, 25. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ju≈øtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> Rom. 8.29.30. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and compa≈ø≈øion on whom I will have compa≈ø≈øion,</hi> Rom. 9.15, 16. <hi>So that it is not of him that wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, This Salvation is to ≈øuch as are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of helping them≈øelves and under mo≈øt mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circum≈øtances, Chri≈øt is that charitable and kind Samaritan to the wounded man by the Thieves, who brings help when the Levite and Prie≈øt (who≈øe Office preach charity) pa≈ø≈øed by without giving any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that other famous Scripture demon≈øtrate the freedom and fulne≈øs of love, when Man was in the wor≈øt of circum≈øtances, when we were without ≈øtrength, Chri≈øt died for the ungodly, God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ≈øinners Chri≈øt died for us, for if when we were Enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ≈øhall be ≈øaved throug his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. to 12.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be a greater in≈øtance of love, pity, and compa≈ø≈øion, than the relieving of one in a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs ≈øtate, ≈øo that Chri≈øts redeeming of Souls is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled, who relieved Enemies, without their own help, or capacity to relieve them≈øelves, and that famous Scripture, of cau≈øing the Dead Bones to take fle≈øh, ≈øinews and life, and become a numerous ho≈øt, is a clear emblem of the Infinite and Free love of God and mans incapacity to relieve him≈øelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. And in that famous place of Gods inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing for his People, when all friends and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are treacherous and helple≈øs, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.4, 5, 6. From all which we may ≈øee, the eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, of Mans ≈øelf incapacity and mi≈øerablene≈øs, and of the fulne≈øs and freedom of Gods Love, and early mercies for him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third excellency and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this great Salvation, is, that it brings with it all ≈øuitable helps and ≈øupplies to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that great Salvation, we find the Apo≈øtle di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to us Gods eternal purpo≈øe of Mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he re≈øolved to bring Man to a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his own Will and Image, <hi>For whom he did foreknow he al≈øo did prede≈øtinate to be conformed to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65284:82"/> Image of his Son, that he might be the fir≈øt born among many Brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29. Whereby we find God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to have the ran≈øomed, and ≈øuch as ≈øhall be ≈øaved by Chri≈øts Blood, to be compleatly ≈øupplied with all things nece≈ø≈øary to adorn and compleat that great Salvation, and this is mo≈øt manife≈øt in the Scripture, <hi>He that ≈øpared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how ≈øhall he not al≈øo with him freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from ≈øuch as fear him: ≈øeek fir≈øt the Kingdom of God and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs thereof, then all things el≈øe ≈øhall be added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> Mat. 6.33. <hi>Ho every one that thir≈øteth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no money come, come ye, buy and eat without money and without price and let your Soul delight it ≈øelf in fatne≈øs,</hi> I≈øa. 55.1, 2. Here we find, a full, free, and cheap Market of all ≈øupplies, from whence may clearly be implyed, Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to have his people whom he adopteth heirs of his Kingdom to be compleatly furni≈øhed with all things nece≈ø≈øary thereunto.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth and ≈øixth may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in one, that this great ≈øalvation, is compleat and full, in that it hath the enjoyment of God, in union of the Father by the Son, in the Spirit, and the Heirs of that Inheritance are made ≈øharers of all Heavenly excellencies, <hi>In thy pre≈øence is fulne≈øs of Joy, and at thy right hand are plea≈øures for evermore,</hi> this is more particularly expre≈ø≈øed by the manifold priviledges of the glorified Saints, and their ble≈ø≈øed Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As it is the re≈øtoring of Man from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt ≈øtate of mi≈øery, and exalting him to the highe≈øt pitch of happine≈øs, as hath been already ≈øhewed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The≈øe of that e≈øtate are entituled to all things as hath been alreardy ≈øhewed.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65284:82"/>
            <p>Thirdly, They ≈øhall be exempted from all manner of mi≈øery, ≈øorrow and grief, They have compleat happine≈øs, and enjoyment of all things as being eternally united to God by Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</p>
            <p>The fifth and la≈øt my≈øtical excellency of this great Salvation, is, in the method taken by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wi≈ødom in the accompli≈øhing of it, to wit, by Chri≈øt the Mediators taking upon him the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and therein making an attonement for Sin in the Fle≈øh.</p>
            <p>This is ≈øo great a my≈øtery that it merits all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Je≈øus Chri≈øt, though he was from the beginning and from all eternity, cloathed with all Maje≈øty and Glory, and the fir≈øt born of all the Creation, the Heir of all things, by whom the World was made, and by whom it ≈øub≈øi≈øts, who being the brightne≈øs of the Fathers glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs Image of his Per≈øon, and by him≈øelf upholding all things, the only begotten Son of God, who≈øe Throne is in glory for ever more, who laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Workman≈øhip of his Hands, neverthele≈øs, according to the Coun≈øel of his own Will, he aba≈øed him≈øelf, to enter into a Virgins Womb, and came into the World, and under the infirmities of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øuffered the highe≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And at la≈øt though he knew no ≈øin, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf unto Death, to make ≈øatisfaction for our ≈øins, this is that my≈øtery which was hid from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 3.9. This is the riches of the glorious my≈øtery of love to the Gentiles, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26. Chri≈øt the hope of glory. And oppo≈øite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is ≈øaid by the holy Prophet and Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul, Eye hath not ≈øeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (be≈øides thee O Lord)
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65284:83"/> what great things he hath trea≈øured up for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.3. And though the Tongues of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, are not able ≈øufficiently to expre≈øs and unfold this great my≈øtery, neverthele≈øs we may ≈øincerely view it, in the≈øe four heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The un≈øearchable dimen≈øions of the love of God to Sinners, in his eternal purpo≈øe of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, before the World began, <hi>To make all men ≈øee, what is the fellow≈øhip</hi> of the my≈øtery which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By his greate≈øt and almo≈øt incredible humiliation, in aba≈øing him≈øelf, to de≈øcend from the highe≈øt pitch of glory, to the lowe≈øt ≈øtep of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mi≈øeries, temptations, ignominies and ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that humane nature could be expo≈øed unto, and to make him≈øelf a Servant, in his ≈øojourning in the World to teach the Go≈øpel, and the my≈øtery of this great Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His further conde≈øcention of aba≈øement to the Wrath of God, and ≈øuffer death for Mans Sin, though he knew no ≈øin, that by his Suffering, Death and Re≈øurrection, he might not only by ≈øatisfaction of Ju≈øtice for Man, redeem him from wrath to come, and procure him eternal happine≈øs; but al≈øo to be a patern of patience and obedience to all for whom he ≈øuffered, and both the≈øe la≈øt heads are contained or expre≈ø≈øed in that of <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> he ≈øhall grow up before him as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of Chri≈øts Humiliation &amp; Aba≈øement for Mans Salvation, is further expre≈ø≈øed by the P≈øalmi≈øt, My God, my God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me, why art thou ≈øo far from helping me, and from the words of my roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

This ≈øheweth in a Type, what indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, reproach and mi≈øery, the Saviour of the World ≈øhould be expo≈øed unto, in the accompli≈øhing of Mans Salvation, and this was actually performed, and brought about at Chri≈øts Suffering, he was mocked reviled and flouted at, when apprehended and brought to the Cro≈øs, He tru≈øted in the Lord, let him deliver him, ≈øeeing he delighted in him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.27, 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.35, 43. Becau≈øe Chri≈øt ≈øuffered leaving us an example that we ≈øhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ≈øteps, who did not ≈øin, neither was guile found in his Mouth, who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again, when he ≈øuffered he threatned not, but committed him≈øelf to him that judgeth righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23.</p>

            <p>This Doctrine and Truth of Mans Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øo accompli≈øhed by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is not only given to us, for our everla≈øting con≈øolation, but al≈øo for our in≈øtruction and direction, in Faith<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Patience, and new obedience, in our ≈øojourning ≈øtate, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though eternal Life, our Redemption, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is freely given and procured by his alone merit, neverthele≈øs he makes every man by a ble≈ø≈øing on his Graces, given to him, in≈øtrumental of his own Salvation, we are commanded <hi>To work out our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling,</hi> and as the Lord waits to be gracious ≈øo he commands and expects to be called upon for all his Mercies which he intends to be≈øtow upon his People, in that famous Scripture where he makes a new Covenant, and Promi≈øes new and clean heart, and to pour out his Spirit, though he doth it freely, and for his own name and glory, yet he doth not intend his People ≈øhould be bare Spectators, and only pa≈ø≈øive in the receipt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but that they ≈øhould be active and ≈øolicitous in the duties of Faith, Patience, New Obedience and Prayer, <hi>I will yet for this ≈øaith tbe Lord, be enquired of by the hou≈øe of</hi> I≈ørael <hi>to do it for them,</hi> and ≈øeeing all the days of our ≈øojourning here, we mu≈øt wait until our change come, and that as our duties are ≈øtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, ≈øo we are obnoxious unto temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and difficulties, and for our help and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ≈øteddily to ≈øteer our cour≈øe, we cannot have a more proper mean than to ≈øet Chri≈øt before us as a

            <p>He teacheth mutual forbearance, and not to return evil, but to do good for evil, ye have heard it ≈øaid, an Eye for an Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I ≈øay unto you, that you re≈øi≈øt not evil with evil<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but who≈øoever ≈øhall ≈ømite thee on thy Right Cheek, turn to him the other al≈øo, if any Man ≈øue thee at Law, to take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak al≈øo, if a Man will compel thee to go with him a Mile, go with him two, hence we are taught the great Spirit of Meekne≈øs, whereof Chri≈øt was the Pattern, and are commanded to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our Pa≈ø≈øionate Re≈øentments of Injuries done us, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.38, 39.

            <p>See that great Doctrine of Mutual Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he that ≈øaith he is in the Light, and hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is in Darkne≈øs even until now, he that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light, and there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øtumbling in him, but he that Hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>We know that we have pa≈ø≈øed from Death to Life, becau≈øe we love the Brethren, he that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death, who≈øoever hateth his Brother, is a Murderer, and ye know, that no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer hath Eternal Life abiding in him, hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we the Love of God; becau≈øe he hath laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our Life for the Brethren, but who≈øoever hath this Worlds good, and ≈øhutteth up his Bowels from the Brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 17. Let us Love one another, for Love is of God, and every one that Loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God, he that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love, in this was manife≈øted the Love of God towards us, becau≈øe God ≈øent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him, herein is the Love of God Manife≈øted, not that we loved him, but that he Loved us, and ≈øent his Son to be a propitiation for our Sins, if God ≈øo loved us, we ought al≈øo to love one another, if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us, and we have known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the love that God hath to us, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1 <hi>Jo,</hi> 4.7, to end.</p>
            <p>A New Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you love one another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.34. from all which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed of the Nature and Extent of Charity, that it doth not con≈øi≈øt, only in naked and bare profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Friend≈øhip, good wi≈øhes, and pretended Re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, but in the Bowels of Tenderne≈øs, Compa≈ø≈øion, Simpathy, and ≈øuitable Supplies, to the nece≈ø≈øities of others, that Charity is not to be ≈øtraitned and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>He Preacheth up the Contempt, and Denyedne≈øs to the World, lay not up Trea≈øure on Earth, where the Moth Cankereth, and Thieves break thorough and ≈øteal, but ≈øeek fir≈øt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou≈øne≈øs, then all the≈øe things ≈øhall be added thereunto, and lay up ≈øtore for your ≈øelves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.19, 20, 32, 33.

            <p>See the Parable of the Rich Husband-Man, who took anxious care for his Earthly Store, but made no Provi≈øion for Eternal Life, but God ≈øaid to him, thou Fool, this Night will I require thy Soul at thy Hands, then who≈øe ≈øhall all the≈øe things be, which thou ha≈øt provided? ≈øo is he who layeth up ≈øtore for him≈øelf, and is not Rich towards God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 16. to 22.</p>

            <p>And to forward our Mortification to the World, let us con≈øider the Advice given by the Holy Apo≈øtle, Love not the World, nor the things of the World, for if any Man love the World, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him, for all that is in the World, the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, the Lu≈øt of the Eye, and the

            <p>Let us further con≈øider the Apo≈øtle <hi>Pauls</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the World, we brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ≈øhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out, and having Food and Rayment, let us be therewith content, but they that will be Rich, fall into many Temptations, and a Snare and many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh and hurtful Lu≈øts, which drown Men in De≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Perdition, for the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil, which while ≈øome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves through with many Sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>This Ble≈ø≈øed Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who is the only Wi≈ødom, Light, and truth it ≈øelf, teacheth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a dependance on him≈øelf, by Faith and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion in all Providences, and as in the foregoing Scriptures, we are taught the emptine≈øs of all other ≈øupports be≈øides him≈øelf, and the emptine≈øs of all other Enjoyments, his purpo≈øe therein, is to wean our Hearts from thence, and fix them on him≈øelf, by Faith and Submi≈ø≈øion in all Providences: he tells us, that a Mans Life con≈øi≈øteth not in the abundance of what a Man hath, in the foregoing In≈øtance of the Rich Husband-Man, and that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God, this was the Doctrine of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> to the People of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when in the Wilderne≈øs they murmured for want of Bread, and when they

            <p>Now as Chri≈øts Doctrine is full and without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, ≈øo his Sufferings are without example, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Sin, not only again≈øt God, but upright al≈øo and perfect, ≈øo as he could not offend again≈øt Mans Law, and that all his ≈øufferings were voluntary,

            <p>Fir≈øt, To bear the Cro≈øs, is Chri≈øts Command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For this we have the Example of Chri≈øt his Prophets, Saints and Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have his Manifold promi≈øes of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Cro≈øs is the inevitable Path and Way, by which he leads his People to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

            <p>Fir≈øt, Patient ≈øuffering and bearing the Cro≈øs is Chri≈øts Command: Chri≈øt Je≈øus, the Word of God, by whom is forgivene≈øs of Sins, and Redemption through his Blood, who made our Peace through the Blood of his Cro≈øs, Preacheth this Doctrine, <hi>come unto me all ye that Labour<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and are Heavy Laden, and I will give you re≈øt, take my Yoak upon you, and learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly in Mind, my Yoak is ea≈øy and my Burthen is Light,</hi> Math. 11.28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>When he ≈øends out his Di≈øciples to In≈øtruct and Convert the World, he tells them, he ≈øends them as Sheep in the mid≈øt of Woolves, he Commands them to be wi≈øe as Serpents, and harmle≈øs as Doves, and that they ≈øhall be brought before Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and hated of all Men for his ≈øake, and that they could not expect better Entertainment than he their Ma≈øter, that they mu≈øt deny Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>Fir≈øt, Under Spiritual darkne≈øs and de≈øertion.</p>

            <p>The ≈øecond Di≈øea≈øe to which Gods Promi≈øes are annexed, is under Temporary afflictions and trials, which though he could ea≈øie and in≈øtantly remove, neverthele≈øs as a wi≈øe and ju≈øt Phy≈øitian, judiciou≈øly con≈øults the Patients Di≈øtemper, and finds that one ≈øingle Do≈øe or Potion is not enough, but that a cour≈øe of Phy≈øick is ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to cure the Di≈øtemper, and as he ≈øtudies neither to gratify the Patients pre≈øent di≈øtempered Palat, nor his unea≈øy humour, but minds the mo≈øt ≈øuitable Medicines, proper method of Cure, order of Diet and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe under the Cure, he confines him to retirement and ab≈øtinence, as well from the luxuriant eating and drinking, and the too great liberty of former conver≈øe, as the cau≈øes and ri≈øe of his di≈øtemper, ≈øo that tender Phy≈øitian of Souls the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, takes the ≈øame method of curing and relieving his afflicted under their di≈øtempers by afflictions, and as he knows the humours, on which the Phy≈øick is to work, that it mu≈øt have liberty and time for operation, and that the Patient mu≈øt needs be ≈øick
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65284:91"/> and anxious for a Cordial; as when a Chirurgeon hath bound up a wound and applied ≈øuitable Plai≈øters pinching and cauthorizing, which nece≈ø≈øarily in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cure mu≈øt annoy, and di≈øquiet the patient, that he will importune the Doctor for a Cordial, to abate his ≈øickne≈øs, and the Chirurgeon to remove the Plai≈øter; neverthele≈øs they wi≈øely con≈øidering, that giving a Cordial, or removing the Plai≈øters before its time, hinders cure, encrea≈øeth more and gro≈ø≈øer humours, therefore gives no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, but advice of Patience, and a≈ø≈øurance of cure, on the due operation of the means; ≈øo this great Phy≈øitian of Souls, though <hi>in all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he is afflicted,</hi> he will take his own time and way for their relief, and affords no other Cordial for the pre≈øent, but that of his univer≈øal promi≈øes, which are exten≈øive to all circum≈øtances of their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ca≈øes and conditions, which may be branched out in the≈øe heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Sickne≈øs. Secondly, Impri≈øonments. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Poverty. Fourthly, De≈øertion, and for≈øaking of friends.

               </gap>nd every of the particular ca≈øes, which is more expre≈øly ≈øet down before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth encouragement for the People of God to bear afflictions patiently, is that the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt is the Path way, that Chri≈øt hath appointed his People to walk to Heaven, for if you be without cha≈øti≈øement, whereof all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, then are you Ba≈øtards and no Sons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, to 12. Wo is me for my hurt, my wound is grievous, but I ≈øaid I mu≈øt bear it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.19, 24. O Lord correct me not in thine anger but in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lea≈øt thou bring me to nothing, I am with

            <p>And this is Chri≈øts Legacy to his followers, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ≈øhall deliver up Brothers to death, the Fathers ≈øhall ri≈øe again≈øt the Children, and Children again≈øt their Parents, and cau≈øe them to be put to Death, and ye ≈øhall be hated of all men for my ≈øake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.6. to 40. and if any man will be my Di≈øciple he mu≈øt deny him≈øelf, lay down his Life<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> take up his Cro≈øs daily, and follow me, if any man ≈øuffer as a Chri≈øtian let him not be a≈øhamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf, for the time is come, that Judgment mu≈øt begin at the Hou≈øe of God, and if it fir≈øt begin at us what ≈øhall the end be of them that obey not the Go≈øpel of God? if the Righteous ≈øcarcely be ≈øaved, where ≈øhall the ungodly appear? wherefore let them that ≈øuffer according to the Will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17, 18. For if God ≈øpared not the natural branches, take heed le≈øt he al≈øo ≈øpair not thee: behold therefore the goodne≈øs and ≈øeverity of God, to them that fell ≈øeverity, but towards thee goodne≈øs, if thou continue in his goodne≈øs; otherwi≈øe thou ≈øhalt be cut off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Is it not the foretold Lot of Gods People, that through tribulation and per≈øecution they mu≈øt enter into the Kingdom of God? and the Di≈øciple cannot expect better entertainment than the ma≈øter, if they have called the Ma≈øter <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> how much more they of his hou≈øe-hold? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24, 25.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The furnace of affliction is the means, by which the wi≈øe contriver of our Salvation, fits his People for the≈øe eternal Man≈øions of Glory, for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65284:92"/> as the Gold≈ømith doth purify his mettal by fire and furnace, to bring it to the pure and true touch, and as the Joiner by Plain and Chi≈ø≈øel fa≈øhioneth his Wood, for his Mortice, even ≈øo the Lord who is of purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity, by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly cha≈øti≈øements, of trials and afflictions, doth poli≈øh and fit his peoples Hearts and Affections, and by bla≈øting the glory of humane enjoyments, he rai≈øeth their de≈øires to the heavenly enjoyments, and fits and fa≈øhions them with ≈øuitable qualifications of holine≈øs, and having experienced the vanity, emptine≈øs, and uncertainty of all earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their affections are wholly rai≈øed unto, and ≈øet upon God alone. The Prodigal had never thought of the plenty, wealth, or glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Hou≈øe, or of returning thither, had it not been that he was pinched and under ≈øtraits. The Church had not thought of returning to her fir≈øt love, had it not been, that her Corn and Wine, and the delicacies by which ≈øhe entertained her ≈øelf with, and lived voluptuou≈øly, were taken away, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The ≈øixth thing to encourage Believers patiently to bear the Cro≈øs, is the great prize of Eternal Life already ≈øpoken of.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected, that the Doctrine of mortification, ≈øelf-denial, and contempt of the World, is a comfortle≈øs, and melancholy Doctrine, and Heaven ≈øeems only to be obtained on hard and dear terms, and that the nece≈ø≈øity of loo≈øing all for Heaven, will encourage the neglect of Heaven, and induce men rather to take <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, in taking plea≈øure and delight in the Creatures, and therein to comfort them≈øelves, and thereby they will be the le≈øs anxious for Heaven, <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øt.</hi> 11.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Doctrine ≈øeems contrary to the Scriptures, which promi≈øes halcyon days to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65284:93"/> Church, and great Honour, Wealth, and pro≈øperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that Kings ≈øhall be her nur≈øing Fathers, and Queens her nur≈øing Mothers, and that the Saints ≈øhall Judge the Earth, how then can this con≈øi≈øt with the contempt of the World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine ≈øeems de≈øparagable, and contrary to the Holy, Ju≈øt, and good Nature of God, to treat the be≈øt of his Friends and People with pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Difficulties and Contempt, and to ≈øuffer the wicked to enjoy their full delight, and among≈øt Men, it will be thought great ingratitude, to treat the be≈øt of Friends, wor≈øe than the wor≈øt of Enemies.</p>
            <p>As it is mo≈øt certain from experience, and Hi≈øtory from the beginning of the World, and coming of Chri≈øt, the People of God have been under the wor≈øt of Temporary Circum≈øtances, ≈øo it is likewi≈øe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the foregoing Di≈øcour≈øe, that this is their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lot, and this hath al≈øo been the ≈øtumbling of the Saints, and particularly to <hi>David,</hi> the wicked's con≈øtant oppulency, quiet, and pro≈øperity, made him much amazed, <hi>P≈øalms</hi> 10. <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> 17.9. to 15. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 37. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 73.3. to 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>See what Holy <hi>Job</hi> the Patient, and Wi≈øe, ≈øaith on this Subject, <hi>The Wicked become Old, they are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Power, their Seed is E≈øtabli≈øhed in their Sight, and Of-≈øpring in their Eyes, their Hou≈øes are ≈øafe from fear, the wrath of God is not upon them, their Bull gendreth and faileth not, their Cow Calveth, and ca≈øteth not her Calf, they ≈øend forth their little ones like a Flock, and their Children dance, they take the Timbrel and Harp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the ≈øound of the Organ, they ≈øpend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to their Grave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ≈øay unto God, depart from us, for we de≈øire not the knowledge of thy war, what is the Almighty, that we ≈øhould ≈øerve him, and what profit have we, if we Pray unto him?</hi> Job 21.7. to 16.</p>
            <p>And the ≈øame Language was in u≈øe in the time of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65284:93"/> the Prophet <hi>Malachy. And ye ≈øaid it is in vain to ≈øerve God, and what profit have we, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and Ordinances, and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord of Ho≈øts? and now we call the proud Happy, and they that work wickedne≈øs, are ≈øet up, yea, even they that tempt God, are delivered,</hi> Mal. 3.14.</p>
            <p>For the full clearing and an≈øwering the≈øe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us con≈øider the things in Competition and Weigh them in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and the≈øe are chiefly two.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Enjoyments of this ≈øen≈øual Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are Temporary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Things Spiritual, which are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As God of his Heavenly Wi≈ødom, made the World for his own glory, and by him≈øelf upholds the ≈øame, and gives to whom he plea≈øeth, what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof he will, ≈øo it is at his plea≈øure to recall what he giveth when he will, ≈øo that Man is but a Sojourner in Earth, and Tenant at Will, for Life, and all Human Enjoyments, and Mans claim thereunto is extingui≈øhable at his plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us con≈øider the va≈øt di≈øproportion in value, between things Temporal, and things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rital: <hi>Solomon</hi> the Wi≈øe≈øt, and of greate≈øt experience hath given us this Te≈øtimony on Record, that all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Enjoyments, are but vanity and vexation of Spirit, <hi>Ecl.</hi> 2. all. The Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the foregoing Scriptures, ≈øheweth the emptine≈øs and vanity of all, that may be challenged for good or great in the World, that all peri≈øh in the u≈øing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. to 17.</p>
            <p>The Holy Evangeli≈øt <hi>John,</hi> gives us the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. ≈øo that the whole that can be pretended to in this World, is ≈øome pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Worlds vanities, attended with unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs, and di≈øcontent of Mind, uncertainty in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65284:94"/> Enjoyment, all being ≈øubject to change, at the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us con≈øider the Nature, Value, and Continuance of things Spiritual; things Spiritual litterally under≈øtood, imply ≈øomething above the ≈øen≈øual Appetite and Perception, and only to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and enjoyed by the Spirit, Mind, or Soul of Man, the Nobler part, and that is Eternal and not ≈øeen, as de≈øcribed by the Apo≈øtle, <hi>while we look not after things which are ≈øeen, but after things which are not ≈øeen; for that which is ≈øeen is Temporal, but that which is not ≈øeen, is Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are to con≈øider, what are the≈øe Spiritual things which Tran≈øcend, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ≈øen≈øual Enjoyments, about which the Soul is only and principally exerci≈øed, which may be briefly comprized in the≈øe four.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Son of God and Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All Spiritual Endowments and Graces given to the Saints, and procured to them by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Sanctified U≈øe of all Temporal and Spiritual Mercies be≈øtowed on the Saints, while in time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Eternal Life obtained, and freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed on the Saints by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>As to the fir≈øt; God of his own free Will, having Created Man in Holine≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65284:94"/> and Man, to re≈øtore Man to the pure and un≈øpotted Image of God, and it being impo≈ø≈øible for Men or Angels, to make ≈øuch Atonement, or to procure a Mediator; The free Love of God, rai≈øeth one up even Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Son of God, and expre≈øs Image of his Father, to take upon him the ≈øhape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and though he knew no ≈øin, to become ≈øin for us; ≈øo that by taking upon him our Nature, and in our ≈øhape and place ≈øubmitting to the Ju≈øtice of God on the Cro≈øs, hath paid the Ran≈øom for us, and re≈øtored fallen man to the Image of God, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs and True Holine≈øs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22, 47, 48.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Man is of the Earth, Earthy; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Man is the Lord from Heaven; and as is the Earthy, ≈øo are they which are Earthy, and as is the Heavenly, ≈øo are they which are Heavenly, and as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we al≈øo ≈øhall bear the Image of the Heavenly; and thus Chri≈øt having paid the Ran≈øom for Sinners, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to all Men the free Market of Salvation, Pardon and Eternal Life; for God ≈øo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who≈øoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ≈øhould not Peri≈øh, but have Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. For when we were without ≈øtrength, Chri≈øt dyed for us; when we were yet Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But it may be Objected that Chri≈øt had a Body, and Mans Nature, and the Re≈øurrection from the Dead, ≈øeems things under the Comprehen≈øion of Sen≈øe and Feeling.</p>
            <p>An≈øwer; Although Chri≈øt had, and took on him Mans Nature, neverthele≈øs the My≈øtery of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Re≈øurrection, A≈øcen≈øion, Communication of Garces and Eternal Life, procured by him, mu≈øt be apprehended by Faith, and can never be reached by Human Sen≈øe; the Natural Man knoweth not the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65284:95"/> things of God, neither indeed can do, becau≈øe they are ≈øpiritually Di≈øcerned.</p>
            <p>The Second thing in the Trea≈øury of Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are the various gifts and graces ≈øpiritually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed by God, to believers in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>He that ≈øpared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all, how ≈øhall he not with him al≈øo, freely give us all things? Ro.</hi> 8.32. The≈øe choice and ≈øpiritual Mercies may be cla≈ø≈øed up in the≈øe three.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Such as are ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the actual laying hold on Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and applying him in his Merits, Sufferings, Re≈øurrection and Glorification, as the only Mediator between God and Man, ≈øuch is Faith, <hi>for without Faith, it is impo≈ø≈øihle to plea≈øe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
            <p>Faith is that Grace whereby Chri≈øt is owned, and upon which Salvation is promi≈øed, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, This is that grace that unites and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates Sinners to God, <hi>for ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi> this is that grace which gives Life, Sap, and being to Chri≈øtians, <hi>Now the Ju≈øt ≈øhall live by Faith, but if any Man draw back, my Soul hath no Delight in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38.

            <p>This e≈ø≈øential Duty is Recommended and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to us in Scriptures, <hi>we are all his Workman≈øhip Created in Chri≈øt to good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we ≈øhould walk in them, and are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation of the Apo≈øtles, and Prophets, Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf being the chief corner Stone, in whom all the Building fitly Framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 2.8, 9, 20, 21.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>They that are after the fle≈øh, do mind the things of the fle≈øh, but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit, to be Carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded, is Life and Peace, becau≈øe the Carnal Man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65284:96"/> is emnity again≈øt God, for it is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; ≈øo the≈øe that are in the fle≈øh, cannot plea≈øe God, and if Chri≈øt be in you, the Body is Dead becau≈øe of Sin, but the Spirit is Life, becau≈øe of Righteou≈øne≈øs; for if ye live after the fle≈øh, ye ≈øhall dye, but if through the Spirit, ye mortifie the Deeds of the fle≈øh, ye ≈øhall live; for as many as are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.5, 7, 10, 13, 14. <hi>and every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth him≈øelf, as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3.</p>
            <p>The third Special grace, coming from this great Magazine of Heavenly Store, is Mortification, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is ≈øuch affinity and connexion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt ≈øpiritual graces, that they are not perfect nor compleat, but when in one Chain, and joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet this grace hath ≈øome thing peculiar in it, as being that ≈øpecial piece of Accompli≈øhment, which frames the Soul to an immediate clo≈øing with Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Mortification is either the curbing or ≈øubduing ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous excre≈øcences, or growth of ≈øuperfluous Humours in the Body, or like proud fle≈øh about a wound under Cure or the total de≈øtroying of that which hath the Preheminence, and may de≈øtroy a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life, as the reigning prevalent Lu≈øts of the fle≈øh, to the De≈øtruction of the Soul; in both which Sen≈øes ≈øpiritual Mortification may be taken; for as the Vine and other Fruit-Trees, are oppre≈ø≈øed by ≈øuperfluous Wood, ≈øo as the Sap is exhau≈øted in feeding ≈øo many ≈øuperfluous Bows, which may bring forth Leaves, weak Blo≈ø≈øoms, but little, or at be≈øt bad Fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe not ≈øufficiently Nouri≈øhed with Moi≈øture from the Root, but the Root being Disburthened from the≈øe excre≈øcences or ≈øuperfluous Boughs, the Root is able to communicate moi≈øture to the remaining part, and the Tree produceth more and better Fruit; even ≈øo when the affections and delight of the Soul,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65284:96"/> are ≈øpent upon the Lu≈øts, and ≈øen≈øual Plea≈øures of the Fle≈øh, the Soul and Spiritual graces are ≈øtarved; and whether for want of ≈øuitab e Encouragement, and therefore the Great and Wi≈øe Husband-Man, and Shepherd of the Soul, by his Cha≈øti≈øements, lops of the ≈øuperfluous delights, and Lu≈øts of the Carnal Heart, either by bla≈øting the Objects of our Lu≈øts and Carnal Delights, or a≈ø≈øi≈øts his People in this great Duty, to mortifie and wean their Affections from the≈øe Objects, and be more fruitful to Eternal Life, by fixing their Hearts on Chri≈øt Je≈øus. Now as all Chri≈øtians are Members of Chri≈øt, and mu≈øt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in him, <hi>John</hi> 15.1. they mu≈øt be ≈øuited for that Ingraftment; and as the Joyner frames his wood, each piece to an≈øwer to another, and cuts it till it fit<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and as the skilful Chyrurgeon by his powder, or Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion cuts off the proud Fle≈øh about the wound, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be clean; and as the Gardner frames the Scyon for the ≈øtock, even ≈øo mu≈øt the Soul be ordered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be ingrafted into that ≈øpiritual Root, Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>In this Spiritual Operation, the≈øe three things are con≈øiderable.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Wherein it con≈øi≈øts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The nece≈ø≈øity of the Cure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The means whereby this Cure is wrought.</p>
            <p>As it mu≈øt be agreed unto, that all Chri≈øtians mu≈øt be renewed, Rooted and built in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, being the chief corner Stone, <hi>If any Man be in Chri≈øt, he is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>In this is fir≈øt the cutting off what is ≈øuperfluous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The grafting the Soul into the New Root, Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>As to the fir≈øt, it is the Cu≈øtom of skilful Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, in cutting any Ulcer or Ulcerated Member, to make a full enquiry into the habit, and di≈øpo≈øition
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65284:97"/> of the Patients Body, and Symptoms of the Grievance, and ≈øome times in his Operation purgeth, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he Mini≈øters Cordials, to prevent faintings, and often times he renders the Patient in≈øen≈øible of the pain by ≈øleep, or otherwi≈øe; and before he begins his Cure, the better to be informed where the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lyeth, if it be a Stone, he u≈øeth ≈øome In≈øtrument to ≈øearch it; if a Wound he clean≈øeth about the Wound, and when he hath made the≈øe Preparations, he makes Inci≈øion without regard of the Patients complaining of pain, until he hath fini≈øhed his Work; ≈øo in this Work of Mortification, a Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mu≈øt do the≈øe three things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He mu≈øt make a full and impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He mu≈øt prepare the Soul for the Cure, he mu≈øt proceed and go on with the Work without partiality, or Indulgence to any ≈øin.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Examination in which the Thoughts and the Objects thereof on which they are mo≈øt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and wherein they mo≈øt delight, are to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, for as the thoughts and affections are ≈øo is the whole Man, therefore he mu≈øt bring them to the line, and to the plummet of Gods Law, to the Law, and to the Te≈øtimony, if ye walk not according to this Rule, it is becau≈øe there is no light in you, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p>To be Carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded, is Life and Peace, and they that are after the fle≈øh, do mind the things of the fle≈øh, but they that are after the ≈øpirit, do mind the things of the ≈øpirit, for that the fle≈øh is Enmity again≈øt God, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.5, 6.7, 8. So that here by the Word of God, we are to examine and judge, and in the Work of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to take ≈øpecial care to get the thoughts, and affections, which are Carnal and Enmity again≈øt God by Nature, to be weaned from the Carnal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and placed on Chri≈øt, and the felicities in him,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65284:97"/> for ye are dead, and your Life is hid with Chri≈øt in God, provide your ≈øelves bags with wax not old, a Trea≈øure in Heaven which faileth not for where your Trea≈øures are, there will your Hearts be al≈øo, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.31, to 35. So the Chri≈øtian being dead to this World, and his Life hid with Chri≈øt in God, like the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom I am Crucified to the World, and the World to me, neverthele≈øs, I live, but not I, but Chri≈øt that liveth in me, and the life that I live in the fle≈øh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. his delight was in Heaven, and not in the ≈øplendor or vanities of this Life; ≈øo that the chief part of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, is to wean the affections from Carnal things, and to rai≈øe, elevate, and place them on things above, and as the thoughts and affections are to be looked unto, even ≈øo are all the words and actions of a Man, and if for every idle word and enormous action, we mu≈øt an≈øwer, how much more are we concerned to ≈øearch into, and Mortifie the Corrupt Fountains from whence flow ≈øuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ≈øour Grapes?</p>
            <p>This Examination mu≈øt be very thorough, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, into every word, and every action, with all the lightning Circum≈øtances and Aggravations thereof.</p>
            <p>This Examination al≈øo mu≈øt be attended with a Godly ≈øorrow, and a hearty Repentance, like that Repentance not to be repented of; for godly ≈øorrow worketh Repentance to Salvation, not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, but the ≈øorrow of the World worketh death, and our Repentance ≈øhould be ≈øuch as the Apo≈øtle De≈øcribes, behold the ≈øelf ≈øame thing that ye ≈øorrow after a godly ≈øort, what carefulne≈øs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ≈øelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement de≈øire, yea, what zeal, yea, what Revenge? and this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65284:98"/> is true Mortification, never to think of old Sins and Corruptions, but with Indignation and Abhorrence, as is more fully explained under the particular Head of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A ≈øecond thing con≈øiderable in the work, is a due preparation; this being no ea≈øie task, no le≈øs difficult, than the divorcing Old Friends, Lovers, and Acquaintances, and the breaking of Old inured Friend≈øhip; therefore the Soul mu≈øt have this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative; he mu≈øt be under the Conviction of a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity, either of peri≈øhing eternally, or be ≈øeparate from the Lu≈øts of the fle≈øh. If any Man be in Chri≈øt, he is a new Creature, Old things are done away. I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husband-Man; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. Now under this Conviction, of the nece≈ø≈øity of having Old Superfluous Lu≈øts, and Carnal de≈øires to be cut off and purged away, or the Soul everla≈øtingly to peri≈øh how ≈øhould not the Soul be wi≈øe, and conde≈øcend to the Divorce, and ≈øay, what have I any more to do with Idols? doth not the great Phy≈øitian of Souls tell us, it is better that one Member peri≈øh, though never ≈øo dear, or de≈øirable to the fle≈øh, than that the whole Body and Soul ≈øhould be ca≈øt into Hell, which will follow inevitably, if not divorced from Lu≈øt, and be renewed in Chri≈øt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20, 30.</p>
            <p>A Second preparation is, to con≈øider the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will accrew by this Divorce of Lu≈øts; ≈øuch who are thus Divorced, ≈øhall be made Sons and Heirs of God with Chri≈øt, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 23. and ≈øhall have all things <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. When lopt off from the World, they ≈øhall be united unto God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, their ≈øhort ≈øufferings, and parting with the Lu≈øts of the World, ≈øhall work for them an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65284:98"/>
            <p>They ≈øhall have trea≈øure in Heaven in≈øtead of, and in exchange of Earthly Riches.</p>
            <p>Their Life ≈øhall be ≈øaved in lo≈øing of it, and lo≈øt in ≈øaving of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9 23, 24, 25. Who then would not part with uncertain Riches for Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, with a rotten Member for a ≈øound Body, a paltry plea≈øure for Eternal happine≈øs?</p>
            <p>Thus the Patient being prepared, of the nece≈ø≈øity of an Inci≈øion to pre≈øerve Life, and with Cordials of promi≈øes to prevent faintings, he mu≈øt go on couragiou≈øly, to cut off all corrupt and fe≈øtered members, of what quality or what≈øoever u≈øe; and for this we have Chri≈øts expre≈øs command, <hi>if thy right Eye or thy right Hand offend thee cut it off,</hi> If Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, or any of the deare≈øt Relations come in competition, all mu≈øt be for≈øaken for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23, 24, 25, 26. Thy life mu≈øt not be preferred to him, but a man mu≈øt take up his Cro≈øs and follow Chri≈øt; ≈øo that nothing however ≈øo choice or dear to us, mu≈øt ≈øtand in the way again≈øt, or in ballance with Chri≈øt, but in all the≈øe things a man mu≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him≈øelf and lo≈øe all for Chri≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>If any man be in Chri≈øt he is a new Creature, old things are done away and all things are made new; mortify therefore your members which are on Earth,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>The fourth Spiritual advantage from Heavenly bounty is Regeneration. It is not enough to cut off old withered branches, or lop Trees; to make them fruitful, and propagate new Trees, but pla≈øhing, ingrafting, or inoculation is nece≈ø≈øary, even ≈øo in the Chri≈øtian Musbandry, though cutting off the old luxuriant branches of Lu≈øt, be ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary by mortification, yet this is not all, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian mu≈øt have a new life, for that by the impurity of Sin, and Concupi≈øcence of our Natures ≈øince the Fall, the whole Ma≈øs of Blood or Nature is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65284:99"/> And God ≈øaw that the wickedne≈øs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was evil continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. Therefore he mu≈øt be ingrafted into Chri≈øt, the true and living Vine, I am crucified to the World, and the World to me, neverthele≈øs I live, but not I but Chri≈øt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the Fle≈øh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. That ye put off concerning their former conver≈øation, which is corrupt according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Lu≈øts, and that ye be renewed in the Spirit of your minds, and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in true holine≈øs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. And be not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this World, but be ye transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of your minds, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Know ye not that Chri≈øt is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be reprobates, now we are no more ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers nor forreigners<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but fellow Citizens with the Saints and with the hou≈øhold of God<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and are built upon the foundations of the Apo≈øtles and Prophets, Chri≈øt Je≈øus being the chief Corner Stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye al≈øo are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.19, to end. All which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach us, that the Chri≈øtian is a new man, hath a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

This holy Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt convinceth the great lawyer <hi>Nichodemus</hi> of the nece≈ø≈øity of Regeneration, of being born again by the Spirit, <hi>Unle≈øs a Man be born again he cannot ≈øee the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3, 5. Now in this great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65284:99"/> concern we are to con≈øider two things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To make a right di≈øcovery of the truth of this new Life by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are to con≈øider ≈øeriou≈øly of the means how this Conque≈øt and new Life may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As this is the greate≈øt concern to man, to be well founded in his claim to Heaven, ≈øo it is ea≈øy to the fle≈øh to be deceived in this thing, for as it often falls out among Women that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by fal≈øe conceptions, and travel long in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Birth, when both they them≈øelves and others are in hopes, yet it proves at la≈øt a deceit, oftentimes to the de≈øtruction of the per≈øon, having nouri≈øhed Di≈øea≈øes and Corruptions in≈øtead of a true Birth, ≈øo no doubt many may ≈øeem to be under conception of this Heavenly Birth, have ≈øome ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and appear to labour under pain, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of the old corruption, and bring forth the Spiritual Birth, and yet Chri≈øt is not formed in them. As the de≈øire of i≈ø≈øue makes many Women u≈øe many unea≈øy and expen≈øive means, ≈øo many men for the lucre of Heaven ≈øtrain far and yet come ≈øhort, becau≈øe their Hearts are not ≈øtraight with God, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered a large ≈øum for the Holy Gho≈øt, the young rich Man in the Go≈øpel kept all the Commandments, <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ≈øold their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and brought the Money to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtributed among≈øt the Saints, and yet all fell ≈øhort of this new Birth, and ≈øo of the Kingdom of God: we are commanded to try the Spirits, for every Spirit is not of God, wherefore, that we may find out the truth and reality of this new birth; It is fit to reflect on the actions of the former Life, and examine the new life in all its parts, and find out whether the ≈øuitable effects of the change and new birth be produced, for according to the effects of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65284:100"/> life ≈øo mu≈øt we judge of the Life, whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed or not, for the Tree is known by its fruits The effects of life are chiefly three.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt The Thoughts earlie≈øt in the conception of the rational creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Affections.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Actions.</p>
            <p>The≈øe three generally make up the whole Man, and as we find the≈øe three concurring in the fir≈øt degeneracy, <hi>The Thoughts of man were evil and only evil continually.</hi> So we find Thoughts, Affections, and Actions, concurring in that fir≈øt tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, the rebellious Thoughts, mutining again≈øt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the lu≈øtful affections after the fruit that was good to eat, and plea≈øant to the Eyes, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired to make one wi≈øe, and the actions in eating thereof. Now as by this degeneracy in our fir≈øt Parents, the whole Nature of Man in <hi>Adams</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacy was corrupted, that thenceforth their thoughts were evil and only evil continually.</p>
            <p>So that what≈øoever mans e≈øtate was at his Fall, he mu≈øt now have a new life by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and as his Nature and whole Man was corrupted, ≈øo mu≈øt he be wholly framed a new, by being tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into that holy frame, after the Spirit and Image of him that created him, and that in all his thoughts, affections and actions, and whether it be ≈øo or not, let every man ≈øearch and try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, and</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In his Thoughts, <hi>If any man be in Chri≈øt he is a new Creature in his Thoughts, let the ≈øame mind be in you, which was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus,</hi> ≈øaith the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle, and a right regulation of a mans thoughts con≈øi≈øts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In placing of them on proper objects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the right Government of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the≈øe objects.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65284:100"/>
            <p>Man in his degeneracy and ≈øtate of Nature, is as in a Feaver, the whole Ma≈øs of Blood being ≈øo di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and infected, that nothing is regular with him, much le≈øs his Thoughts, for that he is of the Earth, Earthly, and in that natural darkne≈øs, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth or can under≈øtand the things of God, like the blind Mole, always working and walking about the Earth and Earthly things, and in his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affection to the Creatures, is hurried with frantick raptures after them, and finding in them no ≈øatisfaction flys from one vanity to another, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove can find no re≈øt, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øaith finds all vanity and vexation of Spirit, ≈øo as he hated all his labour, the Wicked Man <hi>is un≈øtable in all his ways,</hi> but the≈øe renewed are made partakers of the Divine Nature, and place their de≈øires on Heavenly objects, have the ≈øame mind in them that was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, as Chri≈øt came into the World to do the Will of his Father, in the Redemption of Man, and did behave him≈øelf as his Kingdom not being of this World, even ≈øo Chri≈øtians are in this World as Sojourners, and mu≈øt not look on the things of this Life, as the objects of their delight or objects of their inheritance, and therefore mu≈øt be Spiritually minded, <hi>For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ≈øpiritually minded is Life and Peace,</hi> Rom. 8.6. Now the objects of the Spiritual Man mu≈øt be Spiritual, and nothing can with ≈øatisfaction or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, contemplate any thing, but what it hath a re≈øemblance unto, or affinity with it, ≈øo that if the Thoughts be Spiritual, they will be fixed on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Spiritual objects, which are only two.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, One God in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The benefits accrewing to man from thence.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, On God as that only e≈ø≈øential and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65284:101"/> Being by whom the World was made, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in his Infinite Power, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p>In his holine≈øs, of <hi>purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity.</hi> In his Ju≈øtice to reward the upright and condemn the guilty.</p>
            <p>In his Wi≈ødom, As Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf, and who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Wi≈ødom to all Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>In his Love, He is love and dwelleth in love, <hi>God ≈øo loved the World that he ≈øent his only begotten Son, that who≈øoever believeth in him, ≈øhould not peri≈øh but have Eternal Life,</hi> John 3.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>In his Mercy, Witne≈øs his long forbearance and forgivene≈øs of Sins through Chri≈øt Je≈øus, with the merciful thou wilt ≈øhew thy ≈øelf merciful, and with the froward thou wilt ≈øhew thy ≈øelf froward, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 18.25, 26. and ≈øo through all the Attributes of God, where there is an Ocean of Delight to pitch upon, and ≈øwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up and drown all the mo≈øt longing de≈øires, and fill the greate≈øt appetite, on which are ≈øpent the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal breathings and delight of the Angels and Saints in Heaven. Therefore ≈øhall they be before the Throne of God, and ≈øerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ≈øitteth on the Throne ≈øhall dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them, <hi>Rev.</hi>

               </gap>.15.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, On Chri≈øt that Ocean of Con≈øolation to Believers, who ≈øhall have from him fulne≈øs of Joy and Plea≈øures for evermore; who humbled him≈øelf to death to ≈øee them on the Throne of Glory, who was made Sin though he knew no Sin, that Sin might not be imputed to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. Who brought them from being ≈ølaves of Sin to the Inheritance of Son≈øhip and Glory with him≈øelf and made them heirs of all things, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. who is made to Saints <hi>Wi≈ødom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, and Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> and all and in all to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, On the Holy Gho≈øt the Comforter, who ≈øhall
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65284:101"/> dwell and abide with them for ever and teach them all things, and who ≈øhall uphold them in all their ways to guide them in all truth again≈øt all dangers and temptations, <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 91. all. <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17, 26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond object on which the thoughts of the renewed Chri≈øtians are to be exerci≈øed, are the things of great advantage which flow to them from the bounty of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that inexpre≈ø≈øible dignity, honour, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs of being made partakers of the Divine Nature, and being made one, with the Father and the Son in mind, will, and glory, and to be where God is for ever, in that often repeated place, <hi>John</hi> 17. They ≈øhall feed on the Tree of Life, in the Paradi≈øe of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.17. have the white Stone, and in it a new name, and have power over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12, 21. they ≈øhall ≈øit. <hi>On the Throne of Glory before God, and ≈øhall ≈øerve him day and night, ≈øhall hunger no more, nor thir≈øt any more, neither ≈øhall the Sun light on them, or any heat, and God ≈øhall lead them unto living fountains of Water, and wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ≈øhall be no more ≈øorrow,</hi> Rev. 7.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>The thoughts of Believers being thus directed to their proper objects, as they are yet in the Valley of Tears, and obnoxious to the temptations of the Fle≈øh, and ≈øubject to ≈øo many incident di≈øtractions, their thoughts are frequently diverted from their proper cour≈øe; the means thereof to fix them right, when any temptation occurs, whether from the Lu≈øt of the Eyes, Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, or Pride of Life, is to compare the object offered, with that on which the Thoughts ≈øhould center, and bringing infinite beauty, glory, and power, that which is infinitely full of all perfection, and above what eye can ≈øee, or ear hear, or heart apprehend; how
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65284:102"/> ea≈øily may this parrallel eclip≈øe, dazzle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the in≈øinuations of Fle≈øhly Lu≈øts, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh in the u≈øing?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond part of the renewed man is his affections, which al≈øo mu≈øt be ≈øpiritualized and renewed; for if a man be in Chri≈øt, he hath mortified the Fle≈øh and the Lu≈øts thereof, and if the Thoughts be duly placed on God, and the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings flowing from him, it may be the more ea≈øy to regulate the affections.</p>
            <p>It is certain while we are in the Body, there is an unavoidable conver≈øation with the Creature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and the degeneracy hath ≈øo much prevailed, that even in the renewed, there is a law of the Members again≈øt the Law of the Mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Life is a con≈øtant Warfare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. and for this rea≈øon great care mu≈øt be taken to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the affections, and although it is impo≈ø≈øible in ≈øome re≈øpects, to keep the affections from carnal objects, however the renewed man mu≈øt mortify the Fle≈øh and Affections thereof: and as helps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we mu≈øt,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Di≈øtingui≈øh between giving our Affections wholly to any Creature, as re≈øting on that as our chief good, and ≈øo delighting in it, and between letting out our de≈øires to any Creature, in ≈øubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Creator, in ≈øome lawful end, and in this con≈øideration we are to love nothing inten≈øively, with our whole delight and ≈øatisfaction, except God, who alone is able to fill the de≈øires of our Heart, but we may in moderation u≈øe and take ≈øome complacency in the Creature, as helps from God to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us in our Pilgrim ≈øtate, to advance his Honour and di≈øcharge our Duty to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We mu≈øt con≈øider that ≈øince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacy in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Judgment of the Cur≈øe is fallen on all Creatures, and the Creation is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65284:102"/> the Bondage of Corruption, and the Creatures are fallen under the King of this World, as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture for Sin, and the Devil made Prince of the Power of the Air, and this World put under his Dominion (though under re≈øtraint) from God, and that the Natural Man, or Love of the World, is enmity to God. <hi>He that loveth the World, the love of God is not in him,</hi> John 1.2, 15. and by the Apo≈øtle <hi>James,</hi> the friend≈øhip of the World is enmity with God; who≈øoever therefore will be a Friend of the World is the Enemy of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We mu≈øt con≈øider, that Chri≈øts Errand to the World was to reconcile God to Man, and therefore he humbled him≈øelf by taking upon him the Nature of Man, and re≈øtored it from the vanity and impurity of Sin, to all ≈øuch as ≈øhall believe in him: for though the whole Creation was ≈øubjected to ≈øervitude for Sin, neverthele≈øs Chri≈øt by his coming and ≈øuffering, hath paid the Ran≈øom for Believers, and for them removed the Cur≈øe from the Creatures; <hi>Becau≈øe the Creatures al≈øo ≈øhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God, for we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now,</hi> Rom. 8.21, 22. Hence then mea≈øures may be taken to regulate our Affections.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, We ought to love God and ≈øet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on him, above all things, and in loving of him we cannot go the due length, much le≈øs be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ≈øhould love nothing beneath Chri≈øt, but in ≈øubordination to him, and in reference to his glory, and that we may the better ≈øerve him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In our u≈øe of the World, we mu≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Worlds degeneracy, and as in that ≈øtate it is accur≈øed, and the love thereof is enmity to God,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65284:103"/> ≈øo that if we be not our ≈øelves reconciled to God, all the Creatures are accur≈øed to us, and we u≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of them, ≈øo that we mu≈øt u≈øe them as purified to us from the impurity of the Cur≈øe, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and all in a mortified manner, according to the Will of God; <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, that ye may prove what is the good, perfect, and acceptable Will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2.</p>
            <p>In the u≈øe of the Creatures, We mu≈øt u≈øe them without ≈øen≈øual affectation, as things that have a ≈øtamp of danger in them, with fear, le≈øt we be again enticed to ≈øin again≈øt God, in our delight in any thing more, or ≈øo much as in God, and that we be with the Apo≈øtle mortified to all things, <hi>I am crucified to the World, and the World to me,</hi> in that often repeated place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20 Thus then mu≈øt mans Affections be regulated as a new Man, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the old Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, and knowing nothing after the Fle≈øh; the Children of God are all incorporated into a new ≈øociety in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and mu≈øt needs have their Conver≈øation different from the World: <hi>Ye are no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Hou≈øehold of God,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 2.19. Therefore they mu≈øt love and delight in Holy and Spiritual things.</p>
            <p>They are no more <hi>under the Law of Sin to Death, but under the Law of the Spirit unto Life, they are not to walk after the Fle≈øh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 2, 12, 13, 14. Chri≈øt him≈øelf knowing how mans Affections are apt to incline to Earthly Vanities, and ≈øink under the delight of the Creatures, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to lay up Trea≈øure in Heaven, <hi>Where your Trea≈øures are, there your Hearts will be al≈øo.</hi> Seek fir≈øt the Kingdom of God and his Righteou≈øne≈øs, let us follow that choice directory for Holine≈øs and Heavenly mindedne≈øs, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.31, to 35.</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65284:103"/>
            <p>If ye be ri≈øen with Chri≈øt, ≈øeek the≈øe things which are above, where Chri≈øt ≈øitteth at the Right Hand of God, ≈øet your Affections on things in Heaven, and not things on Earth, for ye are Dead, and your Life is hid with Chri≈øt in God, Mortifie therefore your Members which are on Earth.

Thus then we ≈øee how Chri≈øtians are to govern their affections, next we come to con≈øider their Actions, As the Chri≈øtian is and mu≈øt be a New Creature, and Holy in all manner of Conver≈øation, ≈øo mu≈øt he be in his Actions, in two re≈øpects</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They mu≈øt be all Ju≈øt and Holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They mu≈øt be directed to proper ends.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As a Mans Thoughts ought to be pure, and Affections clean, ≈øo mu≈øt his Actions; for one piece polluted, defileth the whole Lump, and a good Tree produceth good Fruit, and there can be no pretence of uprightne≈øs in any Man, where the Actions or Conver≈øation is Corrupt, ≈øo that all Actions of a Man mu≈øt be ≈øquared by the Word of God, and if di≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65284:104"/> thereto, the Conclu≈øion mu≈øt be, that the Fountain is corrupt, for as a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, ≈øo a good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, for the Tree is known by its Fruits, and it is no Ju≈øtification of an Action bad in it ≈øelf, that it is intended well, for we mu≈øt not do evil, that good may come of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Actions mu≈øt be in them≈øelves good, they mu≈øt al≈øo be directed to the right end, that is, to wit, the glory of God, for what is not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ≈øo, are ≈øinful before God; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ≈øaid, may plainly appear, that though the Chri≈øtian as a New Man in Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, is an excellent Creature, as made partaker of the Divine Nature, Neverthele≈øs he is, and mu≈øt be intangled in a continual Warfare, whil≈øt in the Body, and therefore not to be idle or lazy, but to ≈øtand always upon guard, again≈øt Enemies within him≈øelf and without.</p>

            <p>The third thing con≈øiderable in this Conflict of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and Saints Warfare, is the Comfort the Saints have in a Sanctified u≈øe of all Di≈øpen≈øations and Enjoyments, of what they meet with in their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, to have any thing, and not enjoy it, or to want the grace and liberty of right improving of it, is a Cur≈øe, and not a Ble≈ø≈øing.</p>
            <p>Experience teacheth, that many Worldly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, or Mi≈øers, have much of the Worlds Wealth, Riches, and great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and yet their Hearts and Affections are ≈øo forfeited and glutted with the love and delight thereof, that they are ≈ølaves to their fancy, and delight therein, ≈øo as they cannot allow to them≈øelves, the Comfortable u≈øe thereof, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hoard them up (as the Idols of their phancy) to ≈øuch as come after them, or on the other Hand, glut and ≈øatiate them≈øelves therewith, and have not the Grace or Heart to Communicate them in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

            <p>Although the wi≈øe di≈øpo≈øer of all things, makes his Sun to ≈øhine on the Godly and the Wicked, and mo≈øt frequently gives more plentifully of the things of this Life to the Wicked, than to the Godly, neverthele≈øs his Di≈øpen≈øations thereof is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

            <p>Fir≈øt, They are given to the Wicked as Snares, a Cur≈øe and their Portion, and with them Eternal Wrath, for their mi≈ø-improvement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are given to the Godly, only as a means of Sub≈øi≈øtance in their Journey Heaven-ward, with Contentment and the Sanctified u≈øe thereof, with a promi≈øe of Eternal Life in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as their Portion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is mo≈øt certain, and Con≈øequential in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that where the things of this Life are given, and the Heart and Delight is fixed on them as their full and ≈øole Satisfaction, the≈øe things are Cur≈øes, Snares and Entangle the Soul in Mi≈øery, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ≈øuch as place not their Content, Delight, Satisfaction and Happine≈øs in Chri≈øt, are Wicked, and Eternally Accur≈øed, and therefore all their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Snares, and Cur≈øes, and they are mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Enjoyment thereof, and this is evidently proved,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For that as it hath been already ≈øhewn, that Mans Apo≈øtacy by ≈øin hath brought that Cur≈øe on the Creature, ≈øo as the love of the World is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God, and the lawful u≈øe of the Creature is only procured by Chri≈øts Mediation, to ≈øuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</p>
            <p>So that what≈øoever love to the Creature, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments thereof is not for Chri≈øt, and founded on him, is a Cur≈øe, and not a Ble≈ø≈øing: and this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65284:109"/> illu≈øtrated from Rea≈øon, for that Fir≈øt, where Contentment cannot be found, there is no Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no ≈øatisfaction to be found in any thing, without Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt is clear in rea≈øon and common opinion, which place Happine≈øs in Satisfaction of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and De≈øires, and what≈øoever Enjoyment comes not that length, is ≈øhort of Happine≈øs, and brings Anxiety and Di≈øcontent. And this is clear from Common Experience; for let a Man have Wealth, if he have not Health, Strength and Vigor, let him have Riches, and if he have not Honour, let him have one hundred Enjoyments, if any one thing be wanting, which either ≈øome other hath, or he ≈øhall plea≈øe his fancy upon, he is not content, ≈øo not Happy, becau≈øe his Affections or fancy are not plea≈øed, and if we con≈øult <hi>Solomon,</hi> the greate≈øt in Experience, we may conclude, that Happine≈øs in Creature Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not attainable.</p>
            <p>The Second is al≈øo Demon≈øtrate from Rea≈øon and Experience, it being mo≈øt con≈øonant to Rea≈øon, that no contentment can be found, but in that which is permanent and perfect, for that Mans Nature is for Novelties, and cannot re≈øt on any one thing, when ≈øomething el≈øe occurs, which either excelleth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or he doth fancy it doth and indeed it were beneath the Dignity of the Soul, (which is of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Extract) to bottom on any thing, which is not of greate≈øt value; be≈øides the Soul being a Spirit; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not place and confine its delight, to what is only ≈øen≈øual, unle≈øs it could give ≈øatisfaction to the Soul, or Fancy, and that no Satisfaction can be had in ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øual Enjoyments, is apparent from the Nature of all Created beings.</p>

            <p>For an≈øwer we may take up the word content, to ≈øignify the placing our ≈øole and full ≈øatisfaction on ≈øome object, without de≈øiring any farther; and in that ≈øen≈øe, it is unlawful to place our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Creature: or content may ≈øignify, an acquie≈øcence in the u≈øe of any Creature Enjoyment, in the mea≈øure, time, and towards the end it is given us, as being contented with ≈øo much of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as God will give us for our u≈øe in this Life, without murmuring or ≈øtinting of him to time or mea≈øure, and in this ≈øen≈øe is the Apo≈øtle's meaning, as he explains him≈øelf, <hi>I have learned how to want, and how to abound, and in every condition therein to be content,</hi> Phil. 4.11, 12, And yet he longed for Chri≈øt and Eternal Life, and gloried in nothing but in the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, by whom the World was Crucified to him, and he to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. So that though he u≈øed the World with contentment, that is, with acquie≈øcence, it was not his full ≈øatisfaction and re≈øt, but Chri≈øt was his end he drove at, in that u≈øe of the Creature.</p>
            <p>Now as from what hath been ≈øaid, we ≈øee the things of this Life, though they make no happine≈øs,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65284:112"/> they are given both to the Godly and to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. but with the≈øe differences.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Godly have them as owning them from God, the Wicked a≈øcribe them to them≈øelves, or their own indu≈øtry, or ≈øuppo≈øe they have them by chance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are given to the Godly, as In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Journey to Heaven or Travelling expences, but the Wicked have them as their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are given to the Godly with ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to the Will of God, in time, manner and quantity, but to the Wicked with murmuring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, and covetou≈øne≈øs after more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are given to the Godly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for Gods Glory, but the Wicked ≈øpend them on their Lu≈øts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Godly have the Ble≈ø≈øing of owning the di≈øpen≈øation of all things to them as from God, that they are all made, created, and ≈øupported by him, and that they do all flow from him of his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and plea≈øure; For by him were all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and for him, and all things con≈øi≈øt by him, and he is before all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. Every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Light, with whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or ≈øhadow of turning, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> a≈øcribeth all his Power, Greatne≈øs and Grandure to God; He ≈øent from above and took me from many Waters, he delivered me from my ≈øtrong Enemies, and from them which hated me, for they were too ≈øtrong for me, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 18.16, 17, 18, 19, 31, to 41. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 27. to 4.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand the Wicked boa≈øt of their own ≈øtrength, glory, and greatne≈øs, and a≈øcribe all to them≈øelves, as if they were the original of their own glory and greatne≈øs. Is not this great <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65284:112"/> ≈øaith <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which I have built for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Maje≈øty and Glory of my Kingdom? <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Rab≈øecah</hi>'s boa≈øting, Where are the Gods of <hi>Havah,</hi> and the Gods of the City of <hi>Sephervaim?</hi> Who are they of all the Gods of the Countreys, that they ≈øhould deliver them out of my Hand? Thus the Wicked boa≈øt them≈øelves, and give not the glory to God, 2 <hi>Kin</hi> 19.35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond difference is that the Godly have all allowances as helps, and not as their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the Wicked have them as their all, and their Portions; See what Chri≈øt ≈øaith to the Rich Glutton, he had his Portion in this Life, and is chained up in everla≈øting darkne≈øs and mi≈øery, but poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> though he was glad of the Crumbs from under the Rich Mans Table, is placed in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Paradi≈øe of happine≈øs. The Arms of the Wicked ≈øhall be broken, but the Lord upholdeth the Righteous, and their Inheritance ≈øhall be for ever, the Wicked ≈øhall peri≈øh, and be as the fat of Lambs, they ≈øhall con≈øume away, into ≈ømoak ≈øhall they con≈øume, ≈øuch as be ble≈ø≈øed of him ≈øhall inherit the Earth, and they that be cur≈øed of him ≈øhall be cut off, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 18.16, to 29.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt him≈øelf advi≈øeth his People not to be anxious or make provi≈øion for the Fle≈øh, for that he will take care of them, but again≈øt the Wicked who≈øe care is only for this World, he pronounceth Cur≈øes, Wo to you that are Rich for ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your con≈øolation, wo to you that are full for ye ≈øhall hunger; wo to you that laugh now for ye ≈øhall mourn and weep, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20, to 26.</p>
            <p>The third difference is, That the Godly receives the≈øe things with a humble and thankful mind, with ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the Will of God, in giving, taking away, or continuing, but the wicked fret, repine
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65284:113"/> and murmur at every eclip≈øe or change, whereby his Condition ≈øeemeth to be wor≈øted, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou≈øly cur≈øeth God in his Heart, when he hath not his full de≈øire, I create the fruit of the Lips, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ≈øaith the Lord, but there is no peace to the Wicked, ≈øaith my God, the Wicked are like <hi>the raging Sea, ca≈øting up dirt and mire,</hi> I≈øa. 57.19, 20, 21. Hence then ≈øee the different complexion of the Godly and Wicked, the one patiently ≈øubmitting, the other con≈øtantly murmuring; how patiently did <hi>Job</hi> bear the lo≈øs of his Children and va≈øt E≈øtate? The Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Lord hath taken, ble≈ø≈øed be the name of the Lord; in all this <hi>Job</hi> ≈øinned not, neither charged God fooli≈øhly in his Heart, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, ≈øee the re≈øtle≈øs and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable malice of Satan to per≈øecute, <hi>Job,</hi> Job 2. to 6.</p>
            <p>How patiently did <hi>David</hi> ≈øubmit him≈øelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the revilings, cur≈øings, and reproaches of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> and the King ≈øaid, let him cur≈øe, for the Lord hath ≈øaid to him, cur≈øe <hi>David,</hi> who then ≈øhall ≈øay why ha≈øt thou done it? my Son which came out of my Bowels ≈øeeketh my Life, how much more may this Benjamite do it? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>See on the other hand the tragical turbulency, and murmuring temper of the Wicked, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who≈øe Coun≈øel with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ab≈øolom</hi> u≈øed to be as of an Angel of Light, becau≈øe his Coun≈øel was rejected, in the Pride of his Heart he hanged him≈øelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23.</p>
            <p>The fourth difference of Gods di≈øpen≈øations to the Godly and Wicked is, That the Godly are directed and a≈ø≈øi≈øted of God, to level all their actions, and apply all that is di≈øpen≈øed to them, for the Glory and Honour of God; but the Wicked apply all to the gratifying of their Lu≈øts; the Godly believe, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65284:113"/> all things as well in pro≈øperity as in adver≈øity, work together for their good; therefore they level all their purpo≈øes and actions at his glory, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deborah</hi> though by God made eminently in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in that great victory over Gods Enemies, takes not the glory thereof to her ≈øelf, but a≈øcribes it to God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. all.</p>
            <p>The great Steward of Heaven di≈øpen≈øeth the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings of this Life, as the Lord in the Go≈øpel gave forth his Talents to ≈øuch as did profit by them, he tru≈øted them with more, and gave them Eternal Life, as the reward of their care for their Ma≈øters Honour and Profit; but the ≈ølothful and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants are ca≈øt into utter darkne≈øs, where they ≈øhall meet with nothing but <hi>weeping and gna≈øhing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 25.14, to 31.</p>
            <p>Having thus cur≈øorily made enquiry into the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine≈øs of all humane enjoyments, and di≈øcovered that no happine≈øs can be found therein, we come next to inquire into that compleat felicity of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which is the fourth thing trea≈øured up in that bank of Mercy for Believers, and that under the≈øe con≈øiderations.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The freedom of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The fulne≈øs of it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, of the freedom, as all temporal Mercies are of God, as we have already di≈øcovered, ≈øo al≈øo, all Spiritual allowances are of him, and from him, he is the Father of Spirits, and of his free will he hath begotten us by regeneration in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who hath purcha≈øed us with the price of his Blood, God ≈øo loved the World that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that who≈øoever believeth in him ≈øhould not peri≈øh but have Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.17. When we were without ≈øtrength Chri≈øt died for us. God commendeth his Love to us in that while we were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65284:114"/> yet Sinners<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Chri≈øt died for us, That as Sin reigned unto Death, even ≈øo might Grace reign through righteou≈øne≈øs unto Eternal Life through Chri≈øt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. to end. It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ≈øheweth Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
            <p>For by Grace ye are ≈øaved through Faith, not of your ≈øelves, it is the gift of God, not of works, le≈øt any Man ≈øhould boa≈øt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9.</p>
            <p>In hope of Eternal Life which God that cannot lye promi≈øed before the World began, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>Having Prede≈øtinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Je≈øus Chri≈øt unto him≈øelf, according to the good plea≈øure of his Will, in whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the forgivene≈øs of ≈øins according to the riches of his Grace, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 1.5, 7.</p>
            <p>Thus we plainly ≈øee the freedom of this gift of Eternal Life, though purcha≈øed by the Death of Chri≈øt, yet freely given to us by him.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing we are to con≈øider of, is the fulne≈øs of this great gift, and for the clearer di≈øcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, we ≈øhall compare the excellencies of it, with the things of this Life, in all the advantagious circum≈øtances of the ≈øame, whereby we ≈øhall find the excellencies thereof, incomparably excel all that can be pretended de≈øireable in this Life, in all their ≈øuperlative ≈øtate and condition.</p>
            <p>The glory, fulne≈øs and excellency of this World, is laid down by the Apo≈øtle in the foregoing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to con≈øi≈øt in the Lu≈øt of the Fle≈øh, the Lu≈øts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, and the≈øe things peri≈øh in the u≈øing, but he that doth the Will of God abideth for ever: the≈øe being put in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with eternal Life and its excellencies, we ≈øhall ea≈øily find there can be no parrallel when we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and believe the Te≈øtimony of that Evangelical
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65284:114"/> Prophet, Eye hath not ≈øeen nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what great things he hath laid up for ≈øuch as wait on him, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 64.4.</p>
            <p>Hence we may ≈øee an ine≈øtimable difference, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the enjoyments of this Life are only ≈øen≈øual and vani≈øhing, and the others are all Spiritual and La≈øting to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we con≈øider the World as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle de≈øcribes it, and that <hi>The Love of the World is not of the Father,</hi> and by the Apo≈øtle <hi>James,</hi> that <hi>it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity again≈øt God,</hi> and that eternal life is the purcha≈øe of Chri≈øts Blood, how much will this ≈øink the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we compare the Worlds Inventory, that in it is only the <hi>Lu≈øts of the Eyes, the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, and the Pride of Life,</hi> How ≈øoon is this ca≈øt out of the Scales by the Apo≈øtle? <hi>The Kingdom of God con≈øi≈øts not in eating and drinking, chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne≈øs, but in Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho≈øt.</hi> When all that is ≈øaid or can be ≈øaid of the World is ≈øummed up,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In Eating and Drinking.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Apparel to cloath our nakedne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Friends or Relations. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In Riches or Wealth: all which peri≈øh in the u≈øing as is often demon≈øtrated; what Parallel then can be imagined between the≈øe two? For our better ≈øatisfaction, we ≈øhall examine all the≈øe ≈øeverally by them≈øelves and tho≈øe things which come in exchange of them.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Cloaths of the be≈øt, Riche≈øt or Gordious ≈øort which can be invented, afford no cau≈øe of glory, pride, ≈øatisfaction, or content, for at be≈øt they are but badges of our Sin and Mi≈øery, and cau≈øes of grief, mourning, humiliation, and repentance, for that they were at fir≈øt upon <hi>Adams</hi> Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion invented to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65284:115"/> cover our nakedne≈øs, di≈øcovered by ≈øin, which fir≈øt brought ≈øhame, and therefore they are but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of our ≈øhame and nakedne≈øs, in which we ≈øhould neither delight not glory, but rather on ≈øight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of humble our ≈øelves in the ≈øen≈øe of our original guilt and lo≈øt e≈øtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3.7, to 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The be≈øt of Garments have under them infirm Bodies, tainted with natural weakne≈øs at be≈øt, and ≈øometimes the Riche≈øt cover the fraile≈øt Carca≈øe, tainted with noi≈øome Di≈øtempers, the ≈øight of which may make the Garments and what is under them loath≈øome and abhorrent; ≈øo that what we have for our nece≈ø≈øity, to cover our ≈øhame, and hide our loath≈øomne≈øs, ≈øhould not be our Pride, much le≈øs our Delight or Glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Cloaths are often our Burthen, when either by penury we cannot attain to them, or the per≈øons are ≈øo weak that they cannot bear them in Winter to defend the cold, nor in Summer becau≈øe of heat.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fa≈øhion changeth and frets the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent that they cannot have them, and draws the richer to exce≈øs, emulation and prodigality in fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh and unnece≈ø≈øary pomp in the change of fa≈øhions, to the exciting of Lu≈øt and ≈øuperflous wa≈øting what better may be be≈øtowed on the poor, whom God recommends as objects of Charity.</p>
            <p>This being the badge of our ≈øhame and ≈øin, and the ≈øuperfluity thereof ≈øo much abounding now a days, it is worth con≈øideration to reflect on the great threatnings denounced again≈øt ≈øuch vanity and ≈øuperfluity by the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> e≈øpecially again≈øt the Pride of Women. <hi>The Lord ≈øhall ≈ømite them with a ≈øcab, and di≈øcover their ≈øecret parts, and take away all their bravery, and their round tires like the Moon, the changeable ≈øuits of Aparrel, the Mantles, Wimples, and Cri≈øping Pins, the Gla≈ø≈øes, fine Linnen, Hoods and Vails,

            <p>This being one great Idol of the fle≈øh and our ≈øhame, let us ≈øee how this Lu≈øt of the fle≈øh is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øed to the godly and glorified Believers.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, for that all their Sins, and con≈øequently their ≈øhame are taken away in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>For as in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>all died, even ≈øo are all made alive in Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>God ≈øo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who≈øoever believeth in him, ≈øhould not peri≈øh, but have Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>

            <p>The Saints of God have the rotten Garments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, with the Righteou≈øne≈øs of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>The≈øe are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have wa≈øhed their Robes, and have made them≈øelves white in the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7.14, Thus the Saints of God as Inhabitants of the New <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> being Cloathed with the Righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt, are clean≈øed from all ≈øin and ≈øhame, and ≈øo have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of Cloaths to cover ≈øin or ≈øhame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Saints have no occa≈øion for Cloaths, to Comfort the weakne≈øs of their Bodies, for that when rai≈øed from the Dead, they ≈øhall not have Corrupt Bodies of Corruptible Elements, but ≈øhall be Clothed with Spiritual and Incorruptible Bodies, not ≈øubject to change, nor tainted with infirmities of Nature, Hunger, or Cold, <hi>Fle≈øh and Blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Incorruption; for this Corruptible mu≈øt put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this Mortal mu≈øt put on immortality,</hi> 1 Cor.

            <p>Secondly, Eating and Drinking being the ≈øecond Branch of the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, it is ≈øo gro≈øs a predominant and nece≈ø≈øity of Nature and weak Mortality, that it is not only the peculiar Re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Bruits, beneath the Dignity of Mans Soul, and as it is the nece≈ø≈øity of Nature, ≈øo it is the great burden of Nature, to be under that nece≈ø≈øity, that ≈øome Sen≈øuali≈øts, of whom the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>who≈øe God is their Belly, who≈øe glory is their ≈øhame, who mind Earthly things,</hi> and Human Experience tells us, how far this Tyranny upon Man ≈øo prevails, that their luxuriant Appetite, never ≈øuffer them to be at ea≈øe, but either after the quantity or variety of eating and drinking, they are hurryed with further de≈øire, and thereby often mi≈øerably loaded with hurtful di≈øea≈øes, thus delicate Mortals are plunged in mi≈øery, by that they ≈øo much delight in, this was the Ca≈øe of the Rich Glutton in the Go≈øpel, but on the other hand, the Saints in Heaven are not Afflicted with trouble≈øom Appetites, for they <hi>feed on the Manna, in the mid≈øt of the Paradi≈øe of God, for they ≈øhall Hunger no more, nor Thir≈øt any more, for the Lamb ≈øhall feed them, and lead them to living Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Rev. 21.4, 6. their feeding is their Eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding God and the Lamb, but the Wicked feeds on the Eternal Wrath of God, <hi>if any Man Wor≈øhip the Bea≈øt and his Image, and receive his mark on his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or in his Hand, the ≈øame ≈øhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out into the Cup of

            <p>Thirdly, The third Branch of the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, is that in≈øatiable Appetite, the World hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Riches of this Life: what hath already been ≈øaid of the uncertainty, emptine≈øs and vanities of Human Riches, in the foregoing ca≈øe of the Rich Glutton, and the many In≈øtances of that Nature, may give the Complexion of that State: and what Chri≈øt ≈øaith of the Rich Man, that it is hard for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and that the Rich have received their Con≈øolation and Portion in this Life, do all ≈øufficiently illu≈øtrate the Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs and Mi≈øery of that Life, if not rich towards God; but on the other Hand, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God, Mat.</hi> 5.3. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians though never ≈øo poor in this World, have all things in Chri≈øt, <hi>They are Sons and Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chri≈øt, Rom.</hi> 8.17, 32. all which ≈øhew how far the State of the Godly, though Poor in this Life, exceed the Condition of the wicked, though rich as <hi>Crae≈øus,</hi> if not rich towards God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth Branch of the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, is the plea≈øure Men in this World take in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Friends, and Companions: but what is ≈øaid before of this, what Chri≈øt ≈øaith, who loveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Children, Relations, Life it ≈øelf, or any thing el≈øe better than him, is not worthy of him, and who≈øoever loo≈øeth any of the≈øe things for his ≈øake, ≈øhall have double in Heaven, is ≈øufficient to give us a Parallel of the State of the Godly and the Wicked, who Lu≈øt after the Fle≈øh; but let us ≈øee what account the Apo≈øtle gives of a far better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Saints have made of the choice≈øt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but <hi>we are come into</hi> Mount Sion, <hi>the City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeru≈øalem, <hi>unto an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was weary of the Society of wicked Men, <hi>wo is me, that I dwell in</hi> Me≈øheck, <hi>and Sojourn in the Tents of</hi> Cedar; ≈øo when the Saints are ≈øure that <hi>he that ≈øitteth on the Throne ≈øhall dwell with them,</hi> they will freely part with the Company of Sinful Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 120.5.</p>
            <p>The Lu≈øts of the Eyes being the ≈øecond part of the Worlds Inventory, we ≈øhall examine it with the excellent di≈øcovery of the Saints Light, the Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more curious and choice Organ of Natural and Sen≈øual Under≈øtanding and Delight, the right Frame and Complexion thereof affords a Man the greate≈øt Satisfaction of all Sen≈øual Faculties, and yet we ≈øee how frail and weak it is at be≈øt, ≈øoone≈øt and ea≈øie≈øt wounded and dimini≈øhed by Age or Accidents, and mu≈øt needs have ≈øupports by gla≈ø≈øes in Old Age, or otherwi≈øe, and at la≈øt it wholy fails at Death, whereby we find the≈øe two defects in it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is but weak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It altogether fails at Death. <hi>The Silver Threads are cut, and the Golden Bowl broken at the Well, Ecl.</hi> 12. to 6. read all.</p>
            <p>In the≈øe Con≈øiderations, the godly have much the Advantage, for when inlightned they are made of a ≈øpiritual Frame ≈øtrong and vigorous, as being built on Chri≈øt the Rock of Ages by Faith, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in him, and Tran≈ølated into Glory, can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no defect, nor be ≈øubject to any Infirmity, <hi>you hath he quickened, who were once Dead in ≈øin, he hath quickened us together in Chri≈øt,</hi> Eph. 2.1.</p>
            <p>As Chri≈øt being once rai≈øed from the Dead, was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65284:117"/> reed of all further Natural Infirmities, even ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Sinners even in this Life, have the Cataracts and Scales of Natural Darkne≈øs taken off, as ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enlightned, and made partakers of the Divine Nature, and are taught to ≈øee and under≈øtand the My≈øteries of God and Godline≈øs, which the Natural Man knoweth not, nor can under≈øtand; <hi>to be Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, becau≈øe the Carnal Mind is Enmity again≈øt God, for it is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can he, the Carnal Man receiveth not the things of God, for they are fooli≈øhne≈øs unto him, neither can he know them, becau≈øe they are Spiritually di≈øcerned, but he that is Spiritual, judgeth all things,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7. <hi>for who have known the mind of the Lord, that he may in≈øtruct him? but we have the mind of Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Thus Chri≈øtians having the Eyes of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding enlightned, they can ≈øee and under≈øtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinctly, for they walk and ≈øee by Faith, and not by Sen≈øe, and being here as to the World Strangers, and not minding the World in a Carnal Method, as Worldlings do, and as di≈ø intere≈ø≈øed, they do impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially make the more certain ob≈øervation and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things of this Life, <hi>therefore we are always confident, knowing that while in the Body, we are ab≈øent from the Lord, for we walk by Faith, not by Sight, we are confident and willing to be ab≈øent from the Body, and be pre≈øent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.9. The Saints have yet a further excellency in their ≈øight, for when they are Spiritualized in this Life, and the natural igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance taken off by their ingraftment in Chri≈øt, when the≈øe Silver Threads are cut, they are enlightned with the knowledge and ≈øight which fails not, and united to Chri≈øt, that fir≈øt and Original Light, and their knowledge is eternal and unextingui≈øhable, and augmented to the ≈øeeing, not only in part as in this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65284:118"/> Life, but <hi>to know as they are known, and to ≈øee as they ≈øeen eternally in the Heavens, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they al≈øo may be one in us, that they may be perfect in one. We know in part, and we Prophe≈øie in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ≈øhall be done away; when I was a Child, I ≈øpoke as a Child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood as a Child, I thought as a Child, but when I became a Man, I put away Childi≈øh things, for now we ≈øee through a gla≈øs darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then ≈øhall I know, even as al≈øo I am known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>In this ≈øide of time, our Eyes are blurred with Sorrow and Grief, and our ≈øight marred, but in the Tran≈ølation, all Tears ≈øhall be wiped away from our Eyes, <hi>there ≈øhall be no night there, they ≈øhall need no Candle, nor light of Sun or Moon, for the Lord giveth them Light.</hi> Hence plainly may appear, the great difference between the Lu≈øts of the Eyes, in a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man, and the Tran≈øcendent excellencies of the ≈øight of the Saints in glory, for that the Carnal Eye of the Body can only reach ≈øen≈øual Objects, and that under great Infirmities and Weakne≈øs, but the Spiritual Light reacheth Heavenly Objects, and that in full extent, and continues its ≈øtrength to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The la≈øt thing which makes up the Worlds glory and excellency, is the Pride of Life, by which may be under≈øtood all Worldly Honour, Credit, Titles, and Preferments, which do chiefly con≈øi≈øt, either in naked Titles of Honour, or Titles with Preferment and Benefit attending them, in both which re≈øpects, we ≈øhall find that of the glorified Saints, infinitely excell all that can be pretended from the World.</p>
            <p>Worldly Titles of Honour, of the Highe≈øt Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Degree, as Dukes, Kings, Emperors, and ≈øuch like, are ≈øplendid in Carnal Fancy, but having no
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65284:118"/> intrin≈øick value, depending only upon the frothy Opinion of others, the profe≈ø≈øors thereof may fall from them, into more Contempt than they were in e≈øteem by rea≈øon of their Titles, Power and Glory, as daily experience teacheth, but the Saints are <hi>Sons and Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> and their Names, Titles and Dignities are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Records of Heaven, and they are Sealed with Truth that cannot lye, <hi>The grace and calling of God is without Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give a New Name, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Name of Sons and Daughters, the Name of God, and the City of God which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> this is more Honourable, than that of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>George,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> or any of the mo≈øt ≈øplendid Dignities on Earth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Titles are not only glorious, though not made up of the vain and flattering notions of Carnal fancies, and outward gaity and ≈øhew, but are al≈øo accompanyed with the riche≈øt Preferments, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt profit; ≈øuch as are thus dignified with the Name of God on them, are in the Pre≈øence Chamber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, before the Throne of God Day and Night, <hi>and he that ≈øitteth on the Throne, dwelleth among≈øt them, they ≈øhall Hunger no more, neither Thir≈øt any more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhall the Sun light on them, or any Heat,</hi> Rev. 7.15, 16<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 17.</p>
            <p>Though the≈øe be not eminent Titles, yet not all, and what the riche≈øt, greate≈øt, and mo≈øt generous Princes on Earth cannot give, the Lord gives to the Saints, he makes them Sons and Heirs of his Everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory, <hi>he that overcometh, ≈øhall inherit all things, and he ≈øhall be my Son, and I will be his God,</hi> Rev. 21.7. <hi>If ye be ri≈øen with Chri≈øt, then are ye Heirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promi≈øe, and joynt Heirs with Chri≈øt, and becau≈øe ye are Sons, God hath ≈øent forth this Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, whereby ye cry Abba Father,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65284:119"/> wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son, and if a Son, then a Heir of God through Chri≈øt,</hi> Rom. 8.15, 17, 26. He maketh his Saints Co-partners of his own glory with the Father, and placeth them to ≈øit on the Throne with him≈øelf, and <hi>The glory which thou gave≈øt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> Jo. 17.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ≈øit with me on my Throne,, even as I overcame, and am ≈øet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21.</p>
            <p>Hence we ≈øee how far all the Glory, Grandure and Enjoyments of this Life, come ≈øhort to that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Heaven, and expectation of Believers.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed the emptine≈øs of all the≈øe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Earthly pretentions, with the fulne≈øs of the Saints inheritance, we come now to the an≈øwer of the≈øe three foregoing Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Fr≈øt, The Scope of the fir≈øt being, that the Kingdom of Heaven is to be purcha≈øed on hard Terms, by the lo≈øs of all the Comforts, and what's dear in the World, and that ≈øuch Doctrine is Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageable, and inclines Men to to a taking up with, and delighting in the plea≈øures of the Fle≈øh, by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> advice, rather than in the lo≈øs thereof, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly to ≈øeek after ≈øo hard a bargain, as the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> In an≈øwer to which, we mu≈øt lead the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector back to the Survey and Con≈øideration of the two things in Competition, <hi>viz.</hi> Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and things of eternal Life, and when the vanity, uncertainty, and emptine≈øs of the fir≈øt is con≈øidered, and compared with the infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and fulne≈øs in the la≈øt, and as Heaven is of more value than Earth, ≈øo the≈øe earthly things mu≈øt be of le≈øs e≈øteem, than the≈øe Heavenly, and ≈øeeing in Merchandi≈øe, and good Husbandry, the value of the thing in purcha≈øe is con≈øiderable, beyond the price,

            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider God is the Author of life, made Heaven and Earth, and di≈øpo≈øes of it at his plea≈øure, hath he not then the Terms in his own hand? mu≈øt we cut and carve, and make bargains for our ≈øelves, and of our ≈øide only? mu≈øt we have Heaven and Eternal Life, on our Terms, or on Gods Terms? as he have the World to us freely, he may make what Terms he plea≈øeth, and if we will not clo≈øe with God on his Terms, we may, and mu≈øt go without the bargain.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine of ≈øelf-denyal, Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, and Mortification neither doth, or ≈øhould di≈øcourage from the purcha≈øe of Heaven, for that it doth not forbid the u≈øe, or comfort of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but commands that it be u≈øed aright, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God, <hi>What≈øoever is ≈øold in the ≈øham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that eat asking no que≈øtion for Con≈øcience ≈øake, the Earth is the Lords, and the fulne≈øs thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 26.

            <p>We are not forbid the moderate u≈øe of the World, for ≈øupply of our Nece≈ø≈øities, as Mortals, when u≈øed in the fear of God, and in Faith of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, but we are forbidden placing our Affections on Earthly things, when they come in Competition with Chri≈øt, his Honour, and Intere≈øt, and clog our de≈øires and duties towards God, ≈øo as not to ≈øet his glory before us, as the main de≈øign in every thing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Solomons</hi> Advice is mi≈øtaken, as if he he ≈øhould encourage Men to ≈øatiate, and delight them≈øelves, only in the Plea≈øures and Enjoyments of the Creature, without Dependance on God, or to take that of the Creature for their all, and not mind future Happine≈øs; he only in experience of Humane vanities, reproves Mens re≈øting on the Creature, as making an Idol thereof, and advi≈øeth the moderate u≈øe of it, without anxiety, in reproof of the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who in the too exce≈ø≈øive affection of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take not the free and thankful enjoyment of it, but Covetou≈øly hoards it up, and makes a God of it, which he accounts fooli≈øhne≈øs, and warmly reproves re≈øting on Creature delights, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The ≈øecond Objection is, that the Doctrine of Saints ≈øufferings, ≈øeems contrary to Scripture, which in many places promi≈øe peace, Tranquility and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65284:120"/> and plenty to the Church and People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> This is ea≈øily an≈øwered, for either the≈øe promi≈øes are to the Church and People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> all which were conditional on their Obedience, and performed to them, when in their Duty, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon their Repentance, until their falling off in Crucifying the Lord of Glory; however, they are ≈øtill the People of Promi≈øe, and in his own time, he will bring them to his Marvelous light, and ≈øhew them his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In no place of Scripture, hath the Lord promi≈øed a con≈øtant Tyde of Temporary Mercies, but upon their continuing in Duties, and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved to him≈øelf the giving and taking them away, at his Will and Plea≈øure, and for his own ends in his Divine Wi≈ødom, and no Man can pretend to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, but he mu≈øt with <hi>David,</hi> and the Church, confe≈øs, <hi>in Righteou≈øne≈øs ha≈øt thou Corrected me, le≈øs than mine Iniquities do de≈øerve,</hi> La. 1.18. Cha. 3.39. So we may conclude our wants, Afflictions, and Cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are from the Hands of Ju≈øtice for Sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although the Lord often brings his be≈øt People under ≈øore Afflictions, Troubles, and Wants, as experience of all Ages teach us, yet all this is in love and mercy, and but for a ≈øhort time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, and bring them from their ≈øins, and to wean their Hearts from the World, and to wind them up to him≈øelf by Repentance, and to draw their Hearts more eagerly after him, the Kingdom of God and Righteou≈øne≈øs; and as a tender hearted Father leaves not the Child altogether unpuni≈øhed, yet he corrects in mea≈øure, thus the Lords exerci≈øing his Peoples Faith, Patience, and Obedience, can never be ≈øaid to be their Di≈øcouragement, or contrary to any of his gracious promi≈øes to them in Scripture, but ≈øhould rather be atributed to that gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65284:121"/> of <hi>never leaving or for≈øaking of them,</hi> Jer. 30.11. chap. 31.18, 19, 20. I≈øa. 43.2. And in his cha≈øti≈øing of them, he di≈øtingui≈øheth between them and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtards, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, it is the unhappy Lot of the Wicked, to be let run on in all manner of Ryot without puni≈øhment, and their Eyes to ≈øtand out with fatne≈øs, to be given over to their own Hearts Lu≈øts, to their utter de≈øtruction, and to be given over to a reprobate ≈øen≈øe, and to take no pains upon them, but gives them leave to ≈øwallow down the Con≈øolation of their Lu≈øts, with the bitter Pill of Eternal wo. Wo to you that are rich, for you have received your con≈øolation, wo unto you that are full, for ye ≈øhall be hungry; wo to you that laugh now, for ye ≈øhall weep; wo unto you when all men ≈øhall ≈øpeak well of you, for ≈øo did their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the fal≈øe Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24, 25, 26. <hi>Job</hi> 21.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The third Objection is, This Doctrine ≈øeems to be contrary to, and di≈øparageable of the Nature of God, who is holy, loving, ju≈øt, and tender hearted, to ≈øuffer his own Children, who love, and ≈øerve him be≈øt, to be hampered with all the ill u≈øage of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, yea put to Death for his ≈øake, and among≈øt men it would be great ingratitude for a Man to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Children and be≈øt Friends to be thus u≈øed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Lords ≈øuffering his Children to lye for ≈øome time under the ≈ømart of the Rod, can never be imputed to his want of tenderne≈øs for them; for as a Father can hear the complaints of a Di≈øobedient Child under correction, at the ≈øame time his Bowels of Compa≈ø≈øion turn after him, and yet he Corrects, the Phy≈øitian loves and takes care of the Patient, though he will give him no Cordial until the Phy≈øick work, neither will the Chirurgeon take off the Plai≈øters though they ≈ømart, until the wound be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65284:121"/> clean and whole; ≈øo the Lord ≈øuffereth the Rod of Afflictions to work up the ≈øinner to a Conviction, that the Cordials of his Love when reconciled, may be more accepted of, notwith≈øtanding in the mean time his Compa≈ø≈øion faileth not; In all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Pre≈øence ≈øaved them, in his love and in his pity be redeemed them, and bore them all the Days of Old, <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 63.9.</p>
            <p>How ≈øhall I give thee up O <hi>Ephraim?</hi> how ≈øhall I deliver thee O <hi>I≈ørael?</hi> how ≈øhall I make thee as <hi>Zad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> how ≈øhall I ≈øet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> my Heart is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, my repentings are kindled, <hi>Ho≈ø</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p>I have heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning him≈øelf thus, thou ha≈øt cha≈øti≈øed me and I was cha≈øti≈øed, as a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock unaccu≈øtomed to the Yoak: is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a plea≈øant Child? for ≈øince I ≈øpoke again≈øt him, I do earne≈øtly remember him ≈øtill, therefore, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ≈øurely have mercy upon him neverthele≈øs, I will correct thee in mea≈øure and not leave thee altogether unpuni≈øhed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The Lord cannot be counted unkind, much le≈øs ungrateful to his Children, when for a moment he cha≈øti≈øeth them, and recompen≈øeth with eternal Salvation. <hi>I reckon that the ≈øufferings of this pre≈øent Life which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared to the Glory that ≈øhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, while we look not after the≈øe things which are ≈øeen, but after the≈øe things which are not ≈øeen; things which are ≈øeen are temporal, but things not ≈øeen Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 14.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a ≈ømall moment have I for≈øaken thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee, in a little wrath I hid
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65284:122"/> my ≈øelf from thee for a moment, but with everla≈øting kindne≈øs will I have mercy upon thee, ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> I≈øa. 54.7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For his anger endureth but for a moment, in his favour is Life, weeping may endure for a Night but Joy cometh in the Morning,</hi> P≈øal. 30.5.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Lord by his temporary Cha≈øti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be ≈øaid unkind or ungrateful, to the be≈øt of Saints; when he exchangeth the momentany afflictions with Oceans of his goodne≈øs; <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence is fulne≈øs of Joy, and at thy right hand are plea≈øures for evermore,</hi> P≈øal. 16.11.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides all this, Con≈øider the Godly's ≈øtumbling at the Wickeds Pro≈øperity; <hi>Ye have ≈øaid it is in vain to ≈øerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Ho≈øts, and now we call the Proud happy, and they that work Wickedne≈øs are ≈øet up, yea they that tempt God are even delivered?</hi> Mal. 3.14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> that Pattern of Wi≈ødom, Patience, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience gives al≈øo an account of the pro≈øperous ≈øtate of the Wicked, and their arrogancy again≈øt God. And in the ≈øecond part he gives an account of their end; <hi>Job</hi> 21. to 16. thus, <hi>Their Candle is put out, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction cometh on them, God di≈øtributeth on them ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in his anger, they are like the Chaff before the Wind, his Iniquities are ≈øtored up again≈øt his Children, his Eyes ≈øhall ≈øee his de≈øtruction, and he ≈øhall drink of the wrath of the Almighty, what plea≈øure ≈øhall he have in his hou≈øe when his Months are cut off in the mid≈øt of them? the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is re≈øerved to the day of De≈øtruction, they ≈øhall be he brought forth to the day of wrath,</hi> Job 21.16, to end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See the I≈ø≈øue of the Rich Glutton clothed in Purple and fairing daintily, and poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>begging the Crumbs at his gate, and the Dogs licking his Sores; remember that thou in thy Life, receivede≈øt thy good things and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65284:122"/> Lazarus <hi>evil things, but now he is comforted and thou art tormented,</hi> Luke 16.19, to end.</p>
            <p>Hence we may clearly ≈øee Gods bounty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to his People, and well may they relye on his promi≈øes of rich rewards, for their Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ≈øufferings for him. <hi>Verily I ≈øay unto you, that ye who have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man ≈øhall ≈øit in the Throne of his glory, ye ≈øhall al≈øo ≈øit on Twelve Thrones, Judging the Twelve Tribes of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>and every one that hath for≈øaken Hou≈øes or Brethren, or Si≈øters, Father, Mother, or Children, or Lands for my ≈øake, ≈øhall receive one hundred-fold, and ≈øhall inherit everla≈øting Life,</hi> Mat. 19.28, 29.</p>
            <p>The Godly may be per≈øecuted and ≈øuffer Death, but ≈øhall be happy in their Death; Ble≈ø≈øed are they that dye in the Lord, they cea≈øe from their Labour and their Works follow them. And this is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the≈øe are they which come out of great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and have wa≈øhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ≈øerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ≈øitteth on the Throne ≈øhall dwell among them, they hunger no more, neither thir≈øt any more, neither ≈øhall the Sun light on them, or any heat, for the Lamb which is in the mid≈øt of the Throne ≈øhall feed them, and lead them into living Fountains of Waters, and God ≈øhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Is not here a fair recompence for all po≈ø≈øible tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, lo≈ø≈øes, cro≈ø≈øes and ≈øufferings? And on the other hand ≈øee the end of all the voluptuous plea≈øures and enjoyments of the Wicked. If any man wor≈øhip the Bea≈øt and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ≈øame ≈øhall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the Cup of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65284:123"/> his Indignation, and he ≈øhall be tormented with fire and brim≈øtone in the pre≈øence of the Holy Angels, and in the pre≈øence of the Lamb, and the ≈ømoak of their torment a≈øcendeth up for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And they ≈øhall go forth and look on the Carca≈ø≈øes of men that have tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed again≈øt me, for their worm ≈øhall not dye and their Fire ≈øhall not be quenched, and they ≈øhall be an abhorring to all fle≈øh, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 66.2, 4.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand we have the further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Godly; Hear ye the Word of the Lord ye that tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that ca≈øt you out for my names ≈øake, ≈øaid, let the Lord be glorified; but he ≈øhall appear to your joy and they ≈øhall be a≈øhamed, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 66.5.</p>
            <p>And then ≈øhall the Godly ≈øee the accompli≈øhment of the≈øe evangelical Prophecies. My Servants ≈øhall ≈øing for joy of Heart, but ye ≈øhall cry for ≈øorrow of Heart, and howl for vexation of Spirit, and leave your name for a Cur≈øe to my cho≈øen, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 59.18, to 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 65.14, 15. and have all the other comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Promi≈øes and Prophecies made clear to them, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 50. all. <hi>chap.</hi> 60. <hi>chap.</hi> 61, <hi>chap.</hi> 62. <hi>chap.</hi> 63. <hi>chap.</hi> 65. <hi>chap.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p>As we have viewed mans ≈øtate from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and traced the ≈øteps of his toil≈øom Pilgrimage, to his reconciliation to God by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and placed him in the ≈øtate of Adoption by the Covenant of Peace, we come in the next place to con≈øider the difference of mans e≈øtate in the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ≈øure and happy condition in the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Mediator.</p>
            <p>Man in his fir≈øt Creation while in obedience, was the Darling of God, Head and Lord of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on Earth, and had the priviledge of ≈øelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing in all the Creatures, (under re≈øtriction of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65284:123"/> Command,) but lu≈øting again≈øt the command and exceeding his bounds, broke the Chain of obedience and fell under the Cur≈øe: and thus ≈øoon after his being made Lord over the Creatures, his concupi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ambition of enjoying more, and knowing more than what was allowed to him, by the Ju≈øtice of God for his pre≈øumption, he is deprived of his ≈øoveraignty over the other Creatures; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ≈øubject to him, he and they al≈øo are ≈øubjected to the Cur≈øe of Enmity; <hi>I will put enmity between thy Seed and her Seed, it ≈øhall brui≈øe thy Head, and thou ≈øhalt brui≈øe its Heel. Cur≈øed be the Ground for thy ≈øake, in ≈øorrow ≈øhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life,</hi> Gen. 3.14, to 20.</p>
            <p>Whereas upon the other hand, ≈øuch who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy to be within the new Covenant of Peace through Je≈øus Chri≈øt, are founded upon ≈øurer terms of an everla≈øting Covenant that cannot fail or be broken, and tho≈øe within it cannot mi≈øs of having the priviledges and advantages thereof, and the≈øe principally are four.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, This Covenant is everla≈øting not ≈øubject to change or alteration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Faithful with whom it is made, and cannot fail in his performances.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As God who Covenants with his People, is faithful, able, and willing to perform on his part, ≈øo he fits his People to perform on their parts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The great benefit and advantages an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this Covenant eternal Life and all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, This Covenant is everla≈øting, how great a con≈øolation mu≈øt it be to Believers, that they are not only reconciled to God, and the Cur≈øe for Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience taken off by Je≈øus Chri≈øt in his blood, but al≈øo to be within an everla≈øting Covenant with God, and have the Mediator Je≈øus Chri≈øt to make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65284:124"/> Interce≈ø≈øion for them, for when we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øtrength Chri≈øt in due time died for the ungodly, when we were yet Sinners Chri≈øt Died for us; much more being now ju≈øtified by his Blood, we ≈øhall be ≈øaved from wrath through him; if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled by his Death, much more being reconciled we ≈øhall be ≈øaved by his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Wherein God willing more abundantly, to ≈øhew to the Heirs of Promi≈øe, the Immutability of his Coun≈øel, confirmed it by an Oath, by two Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things in which it was impo≈ø≈øible for God to lye, that we might have a ≈øtrong con≈øolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ≈øet before us, wh ch hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul both ≈øure and ≈øtedfa≈øt, and which entreth into that within the Vail, whether the fore-runner is for us entred, even Je≈øus made an High Prie≈øt for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of <hi>Melchi≈øedeck,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>For this cau≈øe he is the Mediator of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, that by means of his Death, for Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions that were under the fir≈øt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, they which are called may receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe of Eternal Inheritance, for Chri≈øt is not enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ≈øelf, now to appear in the pre≈øence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 25.</p>
            <p>If any Man ≈øin we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even Je≈øus Chri≈øt the Righteous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>The whole Scriptures are a ≈øeries of te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of this everla≈øting Covenant with Believers. I will betroath thee unto me for ever in righteou≈øne≈øs, in judgment, in loving kindne≈øs and mercy: I even will betroath thee unto me in faithfulne≈øs and thou ≈øhalt know the Lord. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
            <p>This ≈øhall be my Covenant, not after the manner of their Fathers, but a new Covenant, and I will put
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65284:124"/> my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts and they ≈øhall be my People, and I will be their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.31, to 38.</p>
            <p>They ≈øhall be my People and I will be their God, and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them and their Children after them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is faithful, therefore this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant founded upon his Promi≈øe cannot ≈øail, The gifts and calling of God are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. If my Covenant be not with Day and Night, and if I have not appointed the Ordinances of Heaven and Earth, then will I ca≈øt away the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> my Servant, I will not take away any of his Seed to be Rulers over the Seed of <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for I will cau≈øe their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to return, and have mercy on them, Heaven and Earth ≈øhall pa≈øs away, but one Jot of my word ≈øhall not pa≈øs away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.25, 26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third and main point in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are the qualifications given by God to man to perform this Covenant, for He it is that works all our works in us, in him we live move and have our Being, and without him we can do nothing.</p>
            <p>The≈øe qualifications are principally Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs. Faith by the Apo≈øtle is defined, The Evidence of things not ≈øeen, the Sub≈øtance of things hoped for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p>Faith by the ≈øame Apo≈øtle el≈øewhere is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed: If thou wilt confe≈øs with thy Mouth the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and believe with thy Heart, that God hath rai≈øed him up from the Dead, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved, for with the Heart man believeth unto Righteou≈øne≈øs, and with the Mouth. Man's confe≈ø≈øion is made unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.</p>
            <p>So that Faith is the giving credit to the Word of God in all his Judgments, Threatnings, Promi≈øes, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65284:125"/> di≈øengaging our affections to ≈øin and lu≈øts of the fle≈øh, and turning to God with all our Souls, Hearts, &amp; Minds, and re≈øting confidently and quietly on the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhment of what is promi≈øed, patiently waiting for the ≈øame, and this grace of Faith is accompli≈øhed, and wrought in the Hearts of his People by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; by Grace you are ≈øaved, not of Works, le≈øt any ≈øhould boa≈øt, but by Faith in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, not of your ≈øelves, it is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. and this Grace of Faith, hath he promi≈øed in his New Covenant; they ≈øhall be my People, and I will be their God, and I will give them one Heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and their Children after them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39. this qualification al≈øo hath he promi≈øed to give his People in that often mentioned Scripture, of the New Covenant, A New Heart, a New Spirit will I give them, I will take away the Stony Heart, and give you a Heart of Fle≈øh, and put my Spirit in you, and cau≈øe you to walk in my ways, and ye ≈øhall keep my Judgments, and do them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 26.25, to 29. of this grace and qualification of Faith, we have ≈øpoken el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ewhere.</p>
            <p>The Second qualification to tho≈øe in this Covenant is Holine≈øs, for without Holine≈øs, it is impo≈ø≈øible to plea≈øe God: of this grace and qualification of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, we have ≈øpoken el≈øewhere.</p>
            <p>The Fourth excellency of this Covenant, are the many Advantages attending it, which may briefly be ≈øummed up in the≈øe four.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To the≈øe within this Covenant belong an univer≈øal Inheritance of all things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The certainty of that Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The excellencies of the Companions of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The many Priviledges belonging to tho≈øe within this Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:65284:125"/>
            <p>Although the whole Scriptures are full of the great excellencies of the Heavenly Inheritance, and that place herein is verified, Eye hath not ≈øeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (be≈øides thee O Lord) what he hath prepared, for tho≈øe that wait on him, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 64.4. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 31.19. however they may be thus hinted at.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt is, it is an univer≈øal Inheritance, <hi>He that ≈øpared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all, how ≈øhall he not al≈øo with him, freely give us all things?</hi> Ro. 8.32.</p>
            <p>All Monarchs, Princes and Propriators of the Earth, have certain Confinements, and limits to their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; and ≈øome enjoy, what others cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, either in re≈øpect of the extent of their Countrys, or Qualities or Wealth thereof; but none can pretend in the right of their Inheritance or Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øions, to that unlimitted Intere≈øt of fulne≈øs of right, that the Partners of this Covenant may; for in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, all things are theirs, and <hi>they are Heirs of all things, and ≈øhall Inherit all things,</hi> Rev. 21.5, 6.</p>
            <p>But of him are ye in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who of God is made to us Wi≈ødom, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
            <p>Let no Man glory in Man, all things are yours, whether <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> or the World, Life, or Death, or things pre≈øent, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chri≈øts, and Chri≈øt is Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. to 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Covenant is certain, all pretentions of right, or po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Earthly things, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and ambulatory, and in the experience of mo≈øt, admit of their Eclip≈øe in this Life, witne≈øs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Solomon, Haman, Mordecai, Herod,</hi> and all the great Heroes of this Life, who had their ebbings and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65284:126"/> flowings, and have not been exempted from the fate of changes, and with <hi>Solomon</hi> have found all but vanity and vexation of Spirit, and that often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, the 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. de≈øcribes the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and peri≈øhing condition of the things of this Life, and doth a≈øcertain the Intere≈øt, and certain condition of the fellows of this New Covenant, as is more plainly expre≈ø≈øed el≈øewhere; and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this Life, they leave a Man at be≈øt at his Grave, For we brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ≈øhall carry nothing out, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 7, 17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third excellency of this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is in the Company, Fellow≈øhip, and Society, the fellows of this Covenant have by vertue thereof, Men may have Honour, Wealth, and all other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Delicacies, and all this may be marred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered to them, by the unea≈øine≈øs, un≈øuitablene≈øs, and di≈øagreeablene≈øs of their Companions, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Society; but the Companions of this New Covenant are all de≈øirable, grateful, acceptable, and advantagious; the Soul of <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed by the wickedne≈øs of <hi>Sodom, Job</hi> in his Affliction was Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Wife, and heavily grieved by his three Friends, <hi>David</hi> Sojourned <hi>in Me≈øech, and dwelt in the Tents of</hi> Kedar, and this marred and le≈ø≈øened their quiet, and deprived them of that content they could have had in more agreeable Society; but the Ble≈ø≈øed Harmony of the Saints, increa≈øed the Comfort of all their Enjoyments, they are all ≈øo framed, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and adorned with Holine≈øs, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Love and Unanimity, as they all mind the ≈øame things, and cannot jar or di≈øagree, and their joynt ≈øong is, <hi>Holy, Holy, Lord God of</hi> Sabaoths, <hi>the whole Earth is full of thy Prai≈øe; for through him, we both have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs by one Spirit unto the Father, now therefore ye are no more Strangers and Forraigners, but fellow Citizens
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65284:126"/> with the Saints, and the Hou≈øe-hold of God, and are built upon the Foundation of the Apo≈øtles and Prophets, Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf being the chief Corner Stone, in whom all the Building fitly framed together, groweth into an Holy Temple in the Lord, in whom al≈øo ye are built together, for an Habitation of God through the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 2.18. to 23.</p>
            <p>See the Marks, Characters and Complexion of the Citizens of the New <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> He that walketh righteou≈øly, and ≈øpeaketh uprightly, and di≈øpi≈øeth the gain of oppre≈ø≈øion, that ≈øhaketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that ≈øtoppeth his Ears from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood, that ≈øhutteth his Eyes from ≈øeeing of Evil, he ≈øhall dwell on high, his Habitation ≈øhall be the Munition of Rocks, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 33.15. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 15. The≈øe are they which came out of great Tribulation, which have wa≈øhed their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, no unclean thing can enter there, without are Dogs and Swine, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.45.</p>
            <p>But we are come unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral A≈ø≈øembly, and Church of the Fir≈øt-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all things, and to the Spirits of Ju≈øt Men made perfect, and to the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, which ≈øpeaketh better things, than the Blood of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.22, to 25.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing relating to this State, are the Manifold Priviledges belonging unto them within it, which may be thus expre≈ø≈øed,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They within this Covenant, are all Marked, Sealed and Recorded with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are under an everla≈øting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, in Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To them belong univer≈øal promi≈øes, both in Spirituals and Temporals, and under every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65284:127"/>
            <p>Fourthly, All are united to God in Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They are all Marked, Sealed, and Inrolled with God, as God Marked <hi>Cain,</hi> to keep him from Mans Fury and Rage, for the Murther of his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> when <hi>Cain</hi> was accur≈øed with Gods di≈øplea≈øure, for that Horrid Villany; ≈øo God of his Love to the Saints, Marks them with his own Image, to keep them from the De≈øtruction of Satan, and Inrolls them in the Book of Life, to be called by Name in the Re≈øurrection, <hi>Hurt not the Earth, nor the Sea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have Sealed the Servants of God in their Foreheads;</hi> I≈ø. 4.3. Rev. 7.3.</p>
            <p>The Lord takes that care of his People, that as he commanded by the Pa≈øs-over, the Door-Po≈øts of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to be ≈øprinkled with Blood, as the ≈øign of his Peoples Habitation, ≈øo he puts his Mark of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in the Hearts of his own, to di≈øtingui≈øh them from the wicked, who in their Conver≈øation and Hearts, have Wickedne≈øs and Sin (the Mark of the Bea≈øt) and Wor≈øhip his Image; he Writes on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Name of Righteou≈øne≈øs, and gives them for a Mark, <hi>The white Stone, and in it a New Name, Rev.</hi> 14.9. by which white Stone or Holine≈øs, they are Di≈øtingui≈øhed from the Wicked in their Conver≈øati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the New Name is a Badge of Honour, and ground of inward Con≈øolation to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond advantage of this State is, that they are under an everla≈øting Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To this Covenant do belong univer≈øal promi≈øes, both in Spirituals and Temporals.</p>
            <p>The fourth and great Priviledge of this State, is that My≈øtical and never enough admired Union of the Saints to God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they al≈øo may be one in us, that the World may believe, that thou ha≈øt ≈øent me,</hi> Jo. 14.20. Ch. 17.21.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65284:127"/>
            <p>As Life Eternal is the reward of Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and as this Life Eternal is the great Prize at the end of our Chri≈øtian Race, and as we ought to u≈øe all Diligence, to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, there is no greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be imagined for our help in this, than the faith and due con≈øideration that Believers are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtically united to God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Although all the Creatures and Man e≈øpecially are parts of God, as coming out of the Ma≈øs of Gods Omnipotence, yet Man is no Natural, or Phy≈øical part of God, ≈øo to ≈øpeak; Though Man be Gods by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Man in <hi>Adam</hi> having fallen from God by breach of the Divine Law given to him; God of his Infinite Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs hath provided a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and mean to re≈øtore and unite lo≈øt man to him≈øelf, and this Union is by the renewing of Mans Nature, and changing it unto a Spiritual frame: When we were dead in ≈øins hath he quickned us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Chri≈øt. Now in Chri≈øt Je≈øus ye who ≈øometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Je≈øus, for he is our peace, who hath made both one, and broken down the middle Wall of Partition between us, having in his Fle≈øh aboli≈øhed the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Laws, Commandments contained in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for to make to him≈øelf of twain one new Man, ≈øo making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Cro≈øs, having ≈ølain the enmity thereby, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 13, 14, 15. read all.</p>
            <p>Thus by grafting the Soul on Chri≈øt by Faith, is made a Spiritual Union with God, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Spiritual Ble≈ø≈øings, by a Heavenly Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from Chri≈øt, as the Graft receiveth Sap, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, and made fruitful from the Stock into which it is grafted; this my≈øtical union of Believers between God and them con≈øi≈øts principally in the≈øe four.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65284:128"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In Unity of Spirit with God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In unity of holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In unity of Love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In unity of Glory.</p>
            <p>Of all which Believers are partakers with God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To be one in Spirit, is to be one in Wi≈ødom, Knowledge and Purity of under≈øtanding, now <hi>God is a Spirit, and mu≈øt be Wor≈øhiped in Spirit and Truth,</hi> and though God made Man con≈øi≈øting of a Soul and Body, and did illuminate him with knowledge and under≈øtanding, though under a vail of re≈øtriction; and as ambition, and the concupi≈øence of his Heart, did deprive him of the advantage of his fir≈øt ≈øtate, and the Wi≈ødom of God intending to re≈øtore Man, and place him in a ≈øurer Relation, to wit, (that everla≈øting Covenant of Peace) through the vail of Chri≈øt's Cro≈øs.</p>
            <p>He hath to the renewed be≈øtowed all Spiritual Light and Knowledge, yet becau≈øe we have this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trea≈øure in Earthy Ve≈ø≈øels, and the heavy clogs of our Carnal Bodies, and infirmities of the Fle≈øh, hinder mortals (even though renewed) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and apprehend the≈øe Heavenly excellencies, communicable under that Spiritual Union; and Chri≈øt intending to have the Saints made fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and capable of union with him≈øelf, he prays the Father that they may be one with the Father, as the Father and he is one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, that is to be of one Spirit, Wi≈ødom, and Under≈øtanding: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øuppo≈øed that Chri≈øts intention is, that the Creature though fir≈øt renewed, and afterwards glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, ≈øhould be elevated to that ≈øublimity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, equal with the Father and him≈øelf, but that their perfection ≈øhould be in kind nature, and purity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65284:128"/> of God and Chri≈øts perfection, knowledge, and wi≈ødom, e≈øpecially in the≈øe three re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In purity of Spirit and Spiritual minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In onene≈øs and union of mind and will.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In perfection of Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding. So to under≈øtand things as they are, and not only under the dark ≈øhadows of humane appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt of unity of Spirit. As God is a Spirit, pure, holy, and undefiled, and of purer Eyes than can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity, and that he mu≈øt have all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and Citizens of that new <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> like him≈øelf, and as Chri≈øts promi≈øe is, to prepare a place for his people, in that promi≈øe; Let not your Hearts be troubled, in my Fathers Hou≈øe are many Man≈øions, and I have prepared a place for you, <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. And will have them with him, ≈øo will he have them to be like his Father and him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are holy: ble≈ø≈øed are the pure in Spirit, for they ≈øhall ≈øee God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p>The natural Man is ≈øo cloyed with the liquori≈øh reli≈øh of carnal things, that he cannot rai≈øe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the true contemplation of the things of God, and therefore the Children of God mu≈øt be made ≈øpiritually minded. The Natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God, for they are fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs unto him, neither indeed can he know them, becau≈øe they are ≈øpiritually de≈øcerned, but he that is Spiritual judgeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øtians are new Creatures, and with them old things are pa≈ø≈øed away, and all things become new, they are the Temple of God, God dwelleth in them, who can have no fellow≈øhip with the fle≈øh, therefore they mu≈øt be ≈øpirituallized, for they that are after the fle≈øh, do mind the things of the fle≈øh, but they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65284:129"/> that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. To be carnally minded is Death, but to be ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is Life and Peace, becau≈øe the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity again≈øt God, for it is not ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, ≈øo then they that are after the fle≈øh cannot plea≈øe God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Union of the Spirit is to be of one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to mind the ≈øame things as God and Chri≈øt did before the World began, they have and had one and the ≈øame purpo≈øe, intention, and mind, to do the ≈øame things; Peace and Unity of Spirit in Coun≈øel and otherwi≈øe, is the greate≈øt Comfort and Strength of a Society, and this is the Harmony of Heaven; How doth <hi>David</hi> magnify this choice ble≈ø≈øing? How plea≈øant a thing is it for Brethren to dwell together in unity? it is like the precious ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even <hi>Aarons</hi> Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the Dew that De≈øcended upon the Mountains of <hi>Zion,</hi> for there the Lord commanded the Ble≈ø≈øing even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 133. all.</p>
            <p>The Lord is a Spirit of Meekne≈øs and Peace, and by Chri≈øts Doctrine the ble≈ø≈øing is to the Meek: and his Command is to re≈øemble him in the Spirit of meekne≈øs; I am meek, humble, and lowly in mind, learn of me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. He unites all the Hearts of his People, to the unity of glorifying him, to have their ≈øhare of it in con≈øtant Hallelujah's: ≈øee Gods Promi≈øe to Chri≈øt; and the Spirit of the Lord ≈øhall re≈øt on him, the Spirit of Wi≈ødom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, the Spirit of Coun≈øel and Might, and of the fear of the Lord, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 11. to 10.</p>
            <p>O the admiration of Gods free love and goodne≈øs, to the Godly in their elevation to ≈øuch a ≈øtate of Glory, that he makes them all join in ≈øuch Elogies
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65284:129"/> of his prai≈øes, that they prompt one another to their perpetual ecchoings of his everla≈øting glory, ≈øee what the Apo≈øtle advi≈øeth in this ca≈øe. Keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, let the ≈øame mind be in you which was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, ye are all called to one hope in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4. to 7.</p>
            <p>To be of the ≈øame mind with Chri≈øt Je≈øus, is to have the ≈øame Will and Purpo≈øe which he had, as well in doing as in ≈øuffering, and to do and ≈øuffer to the ≈øame Ends and Purpo≈øes, for which he did or ≈øuffered any thing.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt did and ≈øuffered all things by the joint ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and in obedience of his Father. The Father worketh hitherto and I work. Lo I come to do thy Will, in the volume of thy Book it is written of me, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.</p>
            <p>In his ≈øufferings and acting in the my≈øtery of Man's Redemption, he did all by the re≈øolution of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father and Son did agree and join in the Spirit. God ≈øo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son that who≈øoever believeth in him ≈øhould not peri≈øh, but have Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Here the Father ≈øends, and the Son obeys and cometh, and both agree in one in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the matter of his Pa≈ø≈øion on the Cro≈øs they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in one. <hi>Father if thou wilt let this cup pa≈øs over, but not my Will but thy Will be done,</hi> Mat. 26.39, 42. The Fathers purpo≈øe was that Ju≈øtice ≈øhould be ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Death of the Son on the Cro≈øs, and the Son humbly ≈øubmits. <hi>It is fini≈øhed,</hi> and yields up the Gho≈øt, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. And ≈øo in all the cour≈øe of his Life, as well as at his Death, all his ≈øteps are ≈øquared according to the Will and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel of the Father, as we ≈øee in the Hi≈øtory of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>From hence in imitation of Chri≈øt are taught to us the≈øe two great Duties.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:65284:130"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Submi≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A re≈øignation to the ab≈øolute Will of God.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Submi≈ø≈øion. In all Afflictions, Cha≈øti≈øements, and Sufferings in all ca≈øes, we are to exerci≈øe the duty of Submi≈ø≈øion, <hi>My Son de≈øpi≈øe not thou the cha≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked,</hi> Heb. 12.5, to 12.</p>
            <p>Chearfulne≈øs without murmuring, and a Patient bearing up under every di≈øpen≈øation is the duty of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and with the Apo≈øtle to glory in the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. God forbid that I ≈øhould glory in any thing ≈øave in the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt by whom the World is crucified to me and I to the World. And with the Apo≈øtle <hi>James</hi> count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a great Proficient in this learning of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, I know how to want and how to abound, and in every condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12. And this ≈øhould be the cour≈øe and care of all who re≈øolve to follow Chri≈øt Je≈øus, to frame their mind and will under all di≈øpen≈øations to ≈øubmit and acquie≈øce to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>This was Holy <hi>Davids</hi> practice, under his ≈øo ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and great affliction, when he had fled from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Son <hi>Ab≈øolom,</hi> who had u≈øurped his Crown and when weeping, barefoot, and a≈øhes on his head, ≈øent back from him the Ark of God, the want of which was a great ingredient to his affliction. If I ≈øhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord he will ≈øhew me both it and his Salvation, but if he ≈øay, I have no plea≈øure in him, lo here I am, let him do to me what ≈øeemeth good in his ≈øight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26.</p>
            <p>He had the like ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, when he was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, railed at, and had ≈øtones ca≈øt at him, and was cur≈øed by <hi>Shimei;</hi> Let him Cur≈øe, for the Lord hath

            <p>But what is all this to that entertainment the Lord of Glory Je≈øus Chri≈øt met with on Earth for our Sins, who knew no ≈øin, who was buffeted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled after the mo≈øt outragious manner, and bore it with incredible Courage, Patience and Meekne≈øs.

            <p>Holy <hi>Stephen</hi> ≈øuffered with that meekne≈øs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he gave up the Gho≈øt praying, Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them for they know not what they are doing, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59, 60.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Duty is re≈øignation, as ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion is the patient acquie≈øcing to the Will of God in all his di≈øpen≈øations, without murmuring, and a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedne≈øs in every condition, penury and want as well as in abundance, ≈øo re≈øignation is the chearful giving our ≈øelves up to God to be di≈øpo≈øed of by him in every di≈øpen≈øation, trials, troubles, lo≈ø≈øes and cro≈ø≈øes, under all the exigences of Life.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt would not u≈øe the Arm of Fle≈øh to re≈øcue him≈øelf from being Crucified: but the Cup which the Father put in his hand, even the bitter Cup of his Fathers Wrath, he chearfully drank it out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was his Fathers Will, <hi>John</hi> 18.11.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> was a Pattern of Patience and Re≈øigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: though thou would≈øt ≈ølay me, yet will I tru≈øt in thee.</p>
            <p>The Couragious three Children, who were not daunted with the Decree again≈øt them, their Faith, Courage and Re≈øolution brought them to a holy

            <p>Thus ≈øhould Chri≈øtians in imitation of Chri≈øt, not ≈øo much mind their pre≈øent ≈øufferings, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and condition, as the Duty of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignation, in giving them≈øelves up to the Will of God, in Obedience, Faith, and Patience, and for their encouragement in this, they have Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe of deliverance from his own immediate hands, if other helps appointed by him ≈øhould fail: I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and there was none to help, I wondred that there was none to uphold, therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation unto me, and my right hand it upheld me, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 59.16.</p>
            <p>That other famous place in the Prophecies of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> is a great ≈øtaff to Faith and Re≈øignation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der de≈øertion of all helps even lovers, relations and friends; all thy lovers have for≈øaken thee, they ≈øeek thee not, for I have wounded thee with the wound of an Enemy, with the Cha≈øti≈øement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, becau≈øe thy ≈øins were increa≈øed, therefore all that devour thee ≈øhall be devoured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all thy Adver≈øaries ≈øhall go into Captivity, and they that ≈øpoil thee ≈øhall be a ≈øpoil, and all that Prey upon thee will I give for a Prey, for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtore health unto thee, and heal thee of thy wounds, ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14, to 18. and that other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place in <hi>I≈øaiah, chap.</hi> 49.15. to end, giveth great encouragement to Faith and Re≈øignation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greate≈øt extremities, as being for≈øaken of Friends, Relations, and much oppre≈ø≈øed by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. All things which Chri≈øt did were holy and ju≈øt, he minded only things of a Heavenly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65284:131"/> Nature, as his Kingdom was not of this World, ≈øo all his people mind Heavenly things, they are Strangers and Pilgrims here in this World, and Travellers only with him to the new <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and as Pilgrims mu≈øt not ≈øet their Hearts on things in the Way, but on their Heavenly Trea≈øures.

            <p>Hence we ≈øee, as Chri≈øt minded only Heavenly things, ≈øo he would rai≈øe his People to Heavenly mindedne≈øs, and by his de≈øcription of the World, his purpo≈øe is to wean his Peoples affections from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected, that this Doctrine of the Contempt of the World ≈øeems contrary to the Doctrine and Duty of Charity and Chri≈øts new Commandment, <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and love your Brethren as your ≈øelves,</hi> and that to Believers is al≈øo allowed the comfortable u≈øe of the Creatures, mu≈øt not Parents love their Children, Husbands their Wives, and other Relations which in Scripture is commanded as a Duty, like as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtry and Provi≈øion for Families, how can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt with the not loving of the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> For an≈øwer to this, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who is that wonderful Coun≈øellor, the everla≈øting Father, the Prince of Peace, Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. in whom dwells the Godhead bodily, love it ≈øelf, and Ju≈øtice it ≈øelf, doth not teach incon≈øi≈øtent
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65284:132"/> Doctrines, neither that which is incon≈øi≈øtent with his Holy Nature of Ju≈øtice, Wi≈ødom, Love, and Charity, but all his Doctrines are Coherent and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, therefore we mu≈øt under≈øtand him in the Language of the Spirit,</p>
            <p>The World may be taken up two ways.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and 31. And God ≈øaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, and God re≈øted on the Seventh Day, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Sabbath, and left off working, and Abode not in the glory or beauty of his works, which were all good; but returned to him≈øelf, in that glory with his Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The World may be taken up, when for Mans ≈øin it was Accur≈øed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. and was given into the Hands of the Dragon, and the Prince of the Power of the Air, was made Lord of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. Now in the fir≈øt ≈øen≈øe to love the World as God did, when Man and all things were in Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to behold and enjoy the World, as God did re≈øting into him≈øelf, ≈øo admiring God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and re≈øting in the Creator; this loving and u≈øing the Creature or World, is not incon≈øi≈øtent with the love of God; but to u≈øe and delight in the Creature, when under the Cur≈øe, Power and Dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and re≈øt on it, and not on God, is incon≈øi≈øtent with the love of the Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the words of the Evangeli≈øt, <hi>If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him: and by the Apo≈øtle</hi> James's <hi>Doctrine, know ye not, that the Friend≈øhip of the World is Enmity with God, who≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore will be a Friend to the World, is the Enemy of God, James</hi> 4.4. The≈øe words mu≈øt be meant in the ≈øecond Sen≈øe, as when the World by <hi>Adams</hi> Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion was accur≈øed, and as it were E≈øcheated, and put in Bondage, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.20, 21. to Satan the Prince of the Power of Darkne≈øs: and not when it ≈øtood
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65284:132"/> ≈øtraight with God, and was all good in his Sight: and by the≈øe words, the Love of the Father is not in him, ≈øeems an Anathema, and Cur≈øe to all the Lovers of the World, as the Apo≈øtle el≈øewhere pronounceth a Cur≈øe, if <hi>any Man love not the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, let him be Anathema Marenatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. ≈øo that the love of the World as it is under the Dominion of Satan in the ≈øecond Sen≈øe, cannot be con≈øi≈øtent with the Love and Honour of God.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted, that the Father having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Son for a Ran≈øom for Sinners, but with him al≈øo he will give them all things, and that they have in his right a ≈øurer and better Title to the World, and lawful u≈øe of the things thereof, than the Wicked can pretend to, for that the Godly are Heirs of all things, and the Wicked only U≈øurpers of what they have in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion without right; therefore by the Doctrine of Mortification, Holine≈øs, and Contempt of the World, they are not forbid, and not only permitted, but commanded a lawful Enjoyment of the Worlds good, but in the≈øe different re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That they ≈øhall u≈øe the World, as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing it, that is, they ≈øhall u≈øe it as Pilgrims, for the pre≈øent, ≈øober, and moderate ≈øub≈øi≈øtance, to carry them on in their Journeys Heaven-ward, and not to ≈øit down under the ≈øhadows of Worldly Plea≈øures, as the wicked do, who≈øe Portion it is, with a Cur≈øe upon it to them, <hi>Wo to you that are Rich, for you have received your Con≈øolation, Luke</hi> 6.24. but the Godly are not to ≈øit down with the Rich Husbandman, to Solace their Souls only in the things of this Life, le≈øt with him they ≈øhare of his Judgment, <hi>Thou fool, this Night will I require thy Soul at thy Hand, then who≈øe ≈øhall all the≈øe the≈øe things be which thou ha≈øt?</hi> Luke 12.16, to 22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Children of God do not, nor ≈øhould
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65284:133"/> rely only on the vi≈øible Enjoyments of the Creature as capable of them≈øelves to give ≈øatisfaction, but on God by Faith, and on his Ble≈ø≈øing to make them u≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Mans Life con≈øi≈øteth not in the abundance of what a Man hath, Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God,</hi> Luke 4.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the Lillies who take no care, and ≈øpin not, how they are Cloathed above</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Sow not, and yet are fed,</hi> Luke 12.22, <hi>to</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>All the Power of the Creation is in Gods Hands, as he hath the Power to re≈øtrain, and ≈øu≈øpend, or give a Ble≈ø≈øing upon the Creatures, ≈øo hath he the Store-hou≈øe of Heaven in his Hands, and he can ≈øend ≈øuch plenty, as there may not be room to ≈øtore it up in, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. See all the great and Manifold Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes to his People in Poverty, Streights, and Wants, I≈ø. 41.17, 18. I≈ø. 45.3. <hi>I will give thee the Trea≈øures of Darkne≈øs, and the Hidden Riches of Secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The People of God do, and ought to u≈øe their Enjoyments vertuou≈øly, and do not ≈øquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them on unlawful Lu≈øts, and Plea≈øures, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately u≈øe them for their lawful and ≈øober Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance, or in Charity, and do u≈øe vertuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and improvements; but the Wicked feed their Lu≈øts upon Gods bounty; wherefore the Lord in his Ju≈øtice often Bla≈øts their Enjoyments, and either takes them away from them, or makes them a Cur≈øe in the Enjoyment thereof, <hi>Ye Eat, and have not enough, becau≈øe ye ≈øpend on your Lu≈øts,</hi> James 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>and in that other place, therefore I will return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, See</hi> Ho≈øea 2. <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People of God u≈øe all the Di≈øpen≈øations of God to them, in Sobriety, and vertuous Indu≈øtry, and depend upon God for a Ble≈ø≈øing to their Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but the Wicked live voluptuou≈øly in their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65284:133"/> Enjoyments, and do not principally a≈øcribe to God, the ≈øucce≈øs of their Husbandry, nor depend on him for it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and therefore, in the Ju≈øtice of God, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes from them what they have, or Bla≈øts their Enjoyments in the ≈øucce≈øs of it; ≈øee the Parrable of the ≈øluggi≈øh Servant, in mi≈ø-improvement of the Talent, which was taken from him, and he puni≈øhed with utter Darkne≈øs; ≈øee Gods Judgment upon ≈øuch as do not tru≈øt God with a Ble≈ø≈øing upon their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Mat. 25. <hi>Becau≈øe thou ha≈øt forgotten the God of thy Salvation, and not remembred the Rock of thy Strength, therefore ≈øhalt thou Plant plea≈øant Plants, and ≈øet them with ≈øtrange Slips, in the Day ≈øhalt thou make thy Plant to grow, and in the Morning ≈øhalt thou make thy Seed to flouri≈øh; but the Harve≈øt ≈øhall be a heap in the Day of grief, and of de≈øperate Sorrow,</hi> I≈ø. 17.10, 11.</p>
            <p>See that other Eminent place for this purpo≈øe, <hi>they Hatch Cockatrice Eggs, and weave the Spiders Webb; he that Eateth of their Eggs Dyeth, and that which is cru≈øhed, braketh out into a</hi> Vyper, <hi>their Webbs ≈øhall not become Garments, neither ≈øhall they cover them≈øelves with their Works, their Works are Works of Iniquity and Violence is in their Hands,</hi> I≈ø 59.5, 6.</p>
            <p>See farther to this purpo≈øe, <hi>Ye ≈øhall Sow your Seed in vain, and your Enemies ≈øhall eat it, I will make your Heaven as Iron, and your Earth as Bra≈øs, and your ≈øtrength ≈øhall be ≈øpent in vain, for your Land ≈øhall not yield her increa≈øe, neither ≈øhall the Trees of your Land yield their Fruit,</hi> Lev. 26.16, <hi>to</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ≈øhall eat, and not have enough, they ≈øhall commit Whoredom, and not bring forth; becau≈øe they have left off to take heed to the Lord,</hi> See Job 8.11. <hi>to end.</hi> Ho≈øea 4.10.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider that further Judgment upon the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who tru≈øt to the Fle≈øh, and not to God, <hi>ye have Sown much, and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough, ye drink, and are not ≈øatisfied, ye Cloath you, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65284:134"/> there is none warm, he that earneth Wages, earneth to put in in a bag that hath holes,</hi> Haggai 1. <hi>to</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>See the Manifold Judgments of God Denounced again≈øt Vanity, Pride, and Prodigality, <hi>and it ≈øhall come to pa≈øs, in≈øtead of a ≈øweet ≈ømell, there ≈øhall be a ≈øtench, and in≈øtead of a girdle there ≈øhall be a rent, and in≈øtead of well ≈øet Hair baldne≈øs, and in≈øtead of a ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macher a girdle of Sackcloath, and burning in≈øtead of Beauty,</hi> I≈ø. 3.16. <hi>to end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Wicked ≈øpend and u≈øe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own Plea≈øures, and live in the delight of them, but the Godly are Dead to the World, and delight in nothing but in Chri≈øt, <hi>I am Crucified to the World, and the World to me, neverthele≈øs I live, and yet not I, but Chri≈øt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the fle≈øh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, that loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
            <p>From hence and other Scriptures and Hi≈øtory of the Saints Lives, we ≈øee the different u≈øage of the Godly and Wicked, the Saints are Dead to the World, and their Delight and chief Satisfaction is in God, the Wicked make the World their God, and ≈øole Delight, and glut them≈øelves with Satiety in it; but the Godly can find no Contentment in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with Reference to God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and make him their chief Delight, and cry out, <hi>none but Chri≈øt,</hi> and this is the Prohibition of the Go≈øpel, that we ≈øhould not love Father, Mother, Brothers, or Si≈øters, or our own Life more than God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 38, 39. but God doth not forbid the lawful u≈øe of the Creatures, but only forbids u≈øing it in Vanity, Superfluity, and Prodigality.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In being of the ≈øame Mind with Chri≈øt, is not only to Act, Do, and propo≈øe the ≈øame things with his Father, but al≈øo to do all, and ≈øuffer all for the Glory of God.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:65284:134"/>
            <p>The Worldlings ki≈øs their own Hand, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own Net, and ≈øay, their own Hand hath done it, and a≈øcribe the glory of all the Enjoyments they have to them≈øelves, or to the Creatures in which they delight, and ≈øay, <hi>The≈øe are the Rewards which my Lovers and Companions have given me,</hi> Ho≈øea 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a≈øcribed all to his own Power and Glory, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built for the Hou≈øe of the Kingdom, by the Might of my Power, and for the Honour of my Maje≈øty?</hi> and ≈øee the Event, and Gods Ju≈øt Judgment upon him, <hi>while the word was in his Mouth, there fell a Voice from Heaven, ≈øaying, O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>to thee it is ≈øpoken, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is departed from thee, and they ≈øhall drive thee from Men, and thy dwelling ≈øhall be with the Bea≈øts of the Field, they ≈øhall make thee to eat Gra≈øs as Oxen, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times ≈øhall pa≈øs over thee, until thou know that the mo≈øt High Ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whom≈øoever he will,</hi> Dan. 4.30, <hi>to</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>See the Pride of <hi>Herod,</hi> and taking to him≈øelf the glory due to God, and the fatal Judgment of God on him for it, <hi>And immediately an Angel of God ≈ømote him, becau≈øe he gave not God the glory, and was eaten of worms, and gave up the Gho≈øt,</hi> Acts 12.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand Chri≈øt ≈øet the Fathers glory before him, as the chief Scope and De≈øign of all his Actions and Intentions: When his ≈øuppo≈øed Father <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> and his Mother ≈øought him with Care, and came back to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and found him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple di≈øputing, they told him they had anxiou≈øly ≈øought him, he an≈øwered not with Apology or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe, but ≈øaid, <hi>How is it that you ≈øought me, wi≈øt ye not, that I mu≈øt be about my Fathers Bu≈øine≈øs?</hi> Luke 2.46, <hi>to</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>We ≈øee that he placeth all his Bu≈øine≈øs in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and doing of the Will of God, yea, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65284:135"/> his E≈øteem on all ≈øuch, and accounts ≈øuch only to be his Relations, as obey his Fathers Will, <hi>And Je≈øus an≈øwered and ≈øaid to them, the≈øe are my Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Brethren, which hear the Word of God, and do it,</hi> Luke 8.21.</p>
            <p>We ≈øee in all the Miracles and Wonders Chri≈øt wrought Curing Di≈øea≈øes, and Rai≈øing the Dead, he Exhorts to the giving of glory to God, and more particularly in that Famous place. <hi>Thus ≈øaith the Lord, let not the Wi≈øe Man glory in his Wi≈ødom, nor the Rich Man glory in his Riches, neither let the Mighty Man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Might, but let him that glorieth, glory in this that he knoweth and under≈øtandeth me, that I am the Lord which exerci≈øeth loving Kindne≈øs, Judgment, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs in the Earth, for in the≈øe things I delight,</hi> Jer. 9.23, 24.</p>
            <p>Thus then ought all the Followers of Chri≈øt, to have the ≈øame mind that was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, that is to ≈øet Gods glory as the chief Scope of all De≈øigns and Actions before them, <hi>He that gloryeth, let him glory in the Lord, and what≈øoever we do, whether we Eat or Drink, let us do all things to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.31.</p>
            <p>The World was made by God, and for his Honour, therefore all ≈øhould be a≈øcribed to him, hence we may find, whether the ≈øame mind be in us, which was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, if we do what he did, and to the ≈øame end and glory of God, therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to bring all our Actions and Purpo≈øes to this Touch; for if they be not of this ≈øtamp, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated Counterfeit, and will not be allowed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, for all the Children of God are led by his Spirit, wherefore we mu≈øt try the Spirits, whether the ≈øame mind be in us, which was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; know ye not that Chri≈øt is in you, except ye be Reprobates, but ye are not in the fle≈øh, but in the ≈øpirit, if ≈øo be that the ≈øpirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

            <p>Thirdly, Unity of Spirit is to be one in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is nothing rai≈øeth Mans thoughts more than de≈øire of Knowledge, and nothing Magnifieth Man more than Knowledge, and herein doth Man mo≈øt excel all other Creatures, not only that God hath made them Lords over the Creatures, but that he hat endowed him with a Rational Soul, capable of under≈øtanding above other Creatures, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is the Power, Wi≈ødom, and Goodne≈øs of God more eminent, than by the different mea≈øure of Knowledge be≈øtowed on Mankind; Man in general, exceeds all other Creatures in Knowledge and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, but every Generation and Nation exceed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at ≈øuch a Rate, ≈øo as what in one Age, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is a Riddle, and hid as a My≈øtery, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is Per≈øpicuous, clear and ea≈øie, ≈øo that the knowledge of things is the darling of Ages.</p>
            <p>Although we have the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Fabrick of Heaven, Earth, and the Seas, the indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable and daily Travels of Di≈øcoverers, and the u≈øe of Reading, and the Antients to inform us, either of the parts of the Earth, and Trea≈øures thereof, yet are we ≈øtill to ≈øeek, as well of the Parts, as Trea≈øures of things undi≈øcovered.</p>
            <p>The New Inventions of Mens Ingenuity, or the ≈øecrets of Nature and Power of Art, make it true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øaith, he that increa≈øeth in Knowledge, encrea≈øeth in Sorrow, becau≈øe the Soul of Man is re≈øtle≈øs, and the account of the Idolatry, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65284:136"/> and Rebellion of Man on Earth, is ju≈øt cau≈øe of Sorrow, Grief, and Mourning, becau≈øe of the Di≈øhonour of God, and De≈øtruction of Souls by ≈øin; neverthele≈øs Knowledge is ≈øo choice a thing, that it makes ≈øome Men eminent in under≈øtanding, as much differ from others, as Man generally differs from a Bruit ≈øo that the Schools of under≈øtanding are both courted and de≈øirable.</p>
            <p>Now if the knowledge of the things of this World, be ≈øo de≈øirable and excellent, how much more is the knowledge of God, things of God, and Eternal Excellency, which Nature cannot Fathom? and tho' we had all the Books Written, and attained to all Human Learning, and had all the Ho≈øt of Heaven, and Creation under the Sun to in≈øtruct us, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by can we not be in≈øtructed, or learn the My≈øtery of Mans Redemption, or know Regeneration and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Life, or power of God in the ≈øpirit, much le≈øs be able to find out the Eternal purpo≈øe of God, to the ≈øouls of Believers, or to apprehend that fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of glory, that Believers are intituled unto, and ≈øhall enjoy. Eternally in Heaven, wherefore if we mu≈øt be Wi≈øe to eternal Life, we mu≈øt be Fools to this World, for according to <hi>Solomon, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wi≈ødom,</hi> Prov. 1.7. <hi>So that if any Man lack Wi≈ødom, he mu≈øt ask it of God, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth not,</hi> James 1.5.</p>
            <p>If the Excellency and Advantage of knowing the peri≈øhing ≈øhadows of Earthly things, lead Mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire ≈øo much after that, much more may we be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ≈øeek after the knowledge of God, and of ≈øpiritual things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For that in Human knowledge, there is no perfection, we ≈øee in all Ages, Countries and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one Generation exceedeth the other in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience, and in one and the ≈øame Age,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65284:136"/> one Man far exceeds another, in ≈øo much that the Wi≈ødom of one, is ridiculed by the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All Human knowledge leaves a Man in this life, yea, a Man often ≈øo Declines in his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, that his own Life is his Burden, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Child or Bruit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Mans knowledge is his Burden, becau≈øe he can attain no ≈øatisfaction thereby, it having no end or perfection, ≈øo as all his Life is Anxiety, Trouble and Sorrow, Witne≈øs <hi>Solomon, Ecl.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. all. <hi>Ecl.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The knowledge of Human things puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up, and driveth a Man often ≈øo above his level, that many Learned in Di≈øcontent, have run into Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and ≈øtrangled them≈øelves; but the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowledge of God and ≈øpiritual things, have the quite contrary qualities and effects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Divine knowledge is ≈øo choice a thing, that the more a Man hath of it, he becometh the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, aba≈øeth him≈øelf, and adores God the more, therefore have I uttered that I under≈øtood not, I have heard of thee by the Ear, but now mine Eye ≈øeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ≈øelf, and repent in Du≈øt and A≈øhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.3, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Human knowledge is a Burden, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge is a Delight, becau≈øe the more a Man knoweth, he humbleth him≈øelf the more in ≈øen≈øe of his own Vanity, and is confirmed in his knowledge, becau≈øe by Divine Wi≈ødom, he ≈øees all the ≈øteps Coherent, and tend to his building up in God, and ≈øo delights in that knowledge, <hi>then ≈øhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Ho≈øea 6.3. here is A≈ø≈øurance of Attainment, which is not in Human knowledge, witne≈øs ≈øuch who ≈øpend their Time, Life and Sub≈øtance, in pur≈øuing after that phanciful Foppery, commonly called the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

            <p>Thirdly. As the knowledge of Human things fail and leave a Man in this Life &amp; the knowledge of God and ≈øpirituals attend a Man here to his Grave, and grows and Conducts him, not only to his Grave, but al≈øo to Heaven, <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Their knowledge of God in Faith is their Guide and Comfort, Chri≈øt hath promi≈øed to ≈øend to his People for their Guide, and Comfort the Holy Gho≈øt the Comforter, Even the Spirit of Truth, which the World receiveth not; becau≈øe it knoweth him not, but ye know him, and he dwelleth in you, and ≈øhall be in you; I will not leave you, I will come to you, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the knowledge of Human things is imperfect, and therefore Mens burden, and the cau≈øe of ≈øuch Imperfection may be,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Gods Wi≈ødom to keep Man from boa≈øting of him≈øelf, ≈øo it may be from the changeablene≈øs of Human Objects, in reference to times and ≈øea≈øons, and al≈øo from providential Influence, on the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative part, making it more acute in one Age, than in another, to ≈øhew the ab≈øolute Dependance of all Creatures on the Influence of Providence, as ≈øhall be≈øt plea≈øe God, ≈øo the Wi≈ødom and Knowledge, which is from above, and di≈øpen≈øed to Chri≈øtians on this ≈øide of time, is al≈øo clouded and narrow, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and but in part, not that the Wi≈ødom of God can be dark, but the manife≈øtation thereof may be ≈øo ≈øaid to be, in relation to that full fruition after enjoyed, for that either Wi≈ødom which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. all. Thought fit to let out no more of him≈øelf to Believers, then might be nece≈ø≈øary to the Di≈øcovery of Carnal and Sinful Vanities, and be a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65284:137"/> guide to lead them to Heaven, in longing Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after the more Glorious knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Or Secondly, For that our Crazy and Earthy Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, as old brittle Bottles, were uncapable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ≈øuch inexpre≈ø≈øible Communications of him≈øelf, and the≈øe Eternal Man≈øions of Felicity, which are Trea≈øured up in Chri≈øt Je≈øus for the Saints, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he allows them no more here, than is fit with Comfort to waft them in upon Eternity, and then for the further Manife≈øtation of his own glory, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and wi≈ødom, doth exchange our Mortal and vile Bodies of Du≈øt, not able to receive ≈øuch glory, into immortal Bodies, and then doth manife≈øt him≈øelf to the full to the Saints, who then ≈øhall ≈øee, not in a ≈øhadow only, but plainly as they are ≈øeen, that their glory may be full; for we know but in part, and prophe≈øie but in part but when that which is perfect is come, than that which is in part ≈øhall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for now we ≈øee through a gla≈øs, darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then ≈øhall I know, even as I am known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 9 to 13. and this is that My≈øtical Union of the Spirit, by which the Saints are made one with God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, in that inexpre≈ø≈øible knowledge and ≈øight of God, whereby they ≈øhall be able to ≈øtand in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, face to face, and behold his glory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it.</p>
            <p>The Second Branch of Union with God is Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, God is e≈ø≈øentially Holy, and Holine≈øs it ≈øelf, [who≈øe Name is Holy] <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 51.45. and can as well be divided from him≈øelf, as from Holine≈øs; ≈øo who are one with God, mu≈øt be Holy, and to be Holy, is to be partakers of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt the only begotten Son of God, and expre≈øs Image of his Per≈øon, who≈øe Errand to the World was, only to Reconcile God to Man, knowing how
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65284:138"/> E≈ø≈øential Holine≈øs was to the Bargain, he and all the Prophets and Apo≈øtles Preach up Holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>Holine≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs is the chief piece of the Saints Armour, to fight the Battels of Chri≈øt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. and is that Image of Chri≈øt, to which Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mu≈øt be Conformed to, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.24. and <hi>Colo.</hi> 3.10. and by which they are di≈øtingui≈øhed and known.</p>
            <p>Holine≈øs is that Cloathing of the Saints, who ≈øit with God on his Throne in his Kingdom, the≈øe are the White Robes wa≈øhed in the Blood of the Lamb, and the Brides Wedding Garment, ≈øpoken of in the Go≈øpel, for the clean Linnen is the Righteou≈øne≈øs of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But to this it may be Objected, that Chri≈øt is made to us of God, Wi≈ødom, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Salvation, and Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. ≈øo we need take no care for inherent Holine≈øs in our ≈øelves, but may ≈øit down and re≈øt on his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteou≈øne≈øs, and Rely on his Ju≈øtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> To which may be an≈øwered thus, That it is mo≈øt certain that Chri≈øt is Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to Believers, and that they are Cloathed with his imputed Righteou≈øne≈øs, in the Eyes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of God, and by his Stripes they are healed, and all that Saints could do, would never make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and although Chri≈øt by his Death, hath mo≈øt ≈øufficiently ≈øatisfied Ju≈øtice for our Offences, and that thereby the Father in him is well plea≈øed, neverthele≈øs, as he hath promi≈øed to Reconcile us to the Father, and hath actually Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled ≈øuch as believe in him, and hath to them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed Eternal Salvation by his Blood, and having procured for them Heavenly Man≈øions, to make them Companions with him≈øelf, and his Father, Angels
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65284:138"/> and Saints, there is a nece≈ø≈øity for an Inherent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, with which they mu≈øt be cloathed as that Wedding Garment, and attire ≈øuitable to the Bride, in ≈øuch Heavenly Man≈øions, where no unclean thing can enter in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. and this cloathing and garment is the renewing the Children of God in their Nature, all things are made new, old things are done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>We mu≈øt for≈øake and crucify the World, we mu≈øt dye to ≈øin and live to righteou≈øne≈øs, we mu≈øt be planted in his Death, that we may live in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his Re≈øurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. to 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10, to 14.</p>
            <p>We mu≈øt put on the Nature of Chri≈øt in Spiritual Holine≈øs, Circumci≈øed without hands, putting off the Body of Sin, and are quickned with Chri≈øt by his effectual working of Grace. The Affections mu≈øt be above the Creatures, and the new Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Knowledge after the Image of him who created him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. The Saints live no more to the Fle≈øh, but are dead to it and live by Faith, I am crucified to the World and the World to me, neverthele≈øs I live, but not I, but Chri≈øt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the Fle≈øh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. God forbid that I ≈øhould glory in any thing ≈øave in the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, in whom the World is crucified to me, and I to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p>Thus then inherent Righteou≈øne≈øs, and holine≈øs of the Saints, is that which qualifieth the Soul for union with God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and this holine≈øs though inherent to the per≈øons of all Saints, is not their own growth or product, but is the gift of, and ≈øpecial working of the Spirit of God, he it is alone that gives the new Heart, and creates in them a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65284:139"/> clean Spirit, and takes from them the Heart of Stone, and ≈øits them for this union.</p>
            <p>The Third branch of Saints Union with God, is their being one with him and Chri≈øt in love. I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, and that the World may know that thou ha≈øt loved them, as thou ha≈øt loved me, before the World began, <hi>John</hi> 17.23.</p>
            <p>Love in its perfection is the Darling of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Vertues and Graces, and is ≈øuch e≈ø≈øential part of Holine≈øs and Divine Nature, that it cannot be without it, as God is Holine≈øs. Wi≈ødom, Goodne≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs, ≈øo is he love it ≈øelf; Let us love one another for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God, and he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7, 8, 16.</p>
            <p>Love is Chri≈øts chief command, and from his own example, a new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, by this ≈øhall all men know that ye are my Di≈øciples, if ye love one another, <hi>John.</hi> 13.34, 35.</p>
            <p>Love as the Character and Mark of a Chri≈øtian, is not only a naked and bare profe≈ø≈øion of kindne≈øs and friend≈øhip, but con≈øi≈øts in the≈øe two:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In a firm and con≈øtant ≈øympathy of, and with any, in any afflicted ≈øtate or condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In a con≈øtant, chearful, and ready ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the wants of others, as far as their abilities will reach.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, This love con≈øi≈øts in a con≈øtant and tender ≈øympathy in all troubles, afflictions, and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, in Body, Spirit, or E≈øtate, like as Chri≈øt was; In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Pre≈øence ≈øaved them, in his love, and in his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65284:139"/> pity he redeemed them, and bore them all the days of old, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.9.</p>
            <p>There is denounced a ≈øevere cur≈øe and wo again≈øt ≈øuch as are at ea≈øe, and unconcerned in the ca≈øe of Gods afflicted People. Wo to them that are at ea≈øe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and forget the afflictions of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> Amos 6. to 7. Charity and Sympathy either to the Church of God in general, or to any of the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Saints, is the great badge ornament and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Chri≈øtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 3, to 7. Love is to be in amity and unity, and not in contention one with another love thy Brother as thy ≈øelf. But, if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con≈øumed one of another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øtians ≈øhould con≈øider the height, depth, and full extent of Gods love towards them, which is a my≈øtery pa≈ø≈øing knowledge, that we may be filled with all the fulne≈øs of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øtians in one anothers afflictions, ≈øhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them≈øelves in that holy cement of love, or mutual ≈øympathy and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, to comfort, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a≈ø≈øi≈øt and relieve one another, under their ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral afflictions: ≈øee the woful character of ≈øuch as do not relieve and love his Brother; If a Man ≈øay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, the love of God is not in him, he is a Liar, for he loveth not his Brother whom he hath ≈øeen, and how can he love God whom he hath not ≈øeen, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. And this command have we from him, that he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, loveth his Brother al≈øo, and he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Brother is a Murtherer, and no Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath Eternal Life abiding in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond branch of Divine Love, approved of God to make up the Union of the Saints with God, is that laving out the Bowels of charitable a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, in the ≈øupply of the Saints ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities, like the good Samaritan in the Go≈øpel,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65284:140"/> not only to ≈øee and pity his affliction and condition, but to ≈øupport it: God is not only a bare Spectator of our mi≈øery and maladies, but al≈øo a healer of all our wounds, and is that only Phy≈øitian of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and hath, and applies that balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> even the Bal≈øom of his own Blood to cure us; hereby know we the love of God for us, becau≈øe he laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our life for the Brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. But who≈øo hath this Worlds good, and ≈øeeth his Brother have need, and ≈øhutteth up his Bowels of compa≈ø≈øion from him, how doth the love of God dwell in him? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. If God ≈øo loved us we ought al≈øo ≈øo to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Greater Love hath no man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for a Friend, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13, to 18. The Duty of Chri≈øtian charity is recommended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as the evidence of Chri≈øtian ≈øincerity. The ble≈ø≈øing is to the liberal, the liberal Soul ≈øhall be made fat, and he that watereth ≈øhall be watered him≈øelf, <hi>Pr.</hi> 11, 24, 25, 26. See the exhortation from Chri≈øts own example. But ye know the Grace of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that tho' he was Rich yet for your ≈øakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that ye through his Poverty might be Rich: and that famous exhortation, con≈øider them that are in bonds as being bound with them, and ≈øuch as are in adver≈øity, as being your ≈øelves in the Body, <hi>Hebrews.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>See how the Apo≈øtle <hi>James</hi> challengeth a naked beholder of the poor, naked and indigent; If a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Si≈øter be naked and de≈øtitute of daily food, and one of you ≈øay, depart in Peace, and be you warmed and filled, notwith≈øtanding ye give them not the≈øe things which are needful, what doth it profit? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16. So that it is not bare profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion which makes Love, but the fulfilling of the Commandment, love thy Neighbour as thy ≈øelf, as Chri≈øt loved his Church and laid down his Life for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65284:140"/> her, ≈øo ought we al≈øo for whom Chri≈øt died. Hence we ≈øee how great is the Priviledge of Believers for whom Chri≈øt both died and is ri≈øen again, and taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Heaven for them, and that the Father will love them with the ≈øame love, with which he loved his only Son, before the World was, ≈øo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ≈øhould not be affraid, for Love admits no fear; There is no fear in Love, for perfect love ca≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fear, becau≈øe fear hath torment, he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is not made perfect in Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>What quiet and comfort therefore may Believers have, who find that love of God con≈øtraining them to wait on him by Faith, may with <hi>David</hi> ≈øay, we will not fear what man can do unto us, and with the Apo≈øtle, if God be with us who can be again≈øt us? be of good courage for God will ≈øtrengthen your Hearts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the Saints are one with God and Chri≈øt. 1. In Spirit. 2. In Holine≈øs. 3. In Love. So 4. In Glory, which is the highe≈øt priviledge ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and is clearly held out in the Text; And the glory thou ha≈øt given me, I have given them, that they may be One even as we are One. Father I will that they al≈øo which thou ha≈øt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which thou ha≈øt given me, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 24. And as God ≈øo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son to dye for Sinners, ≈øo Chri≈øt continues his Love, that he will have all for whom he died, to ≈øhare of the ≈øame glory with him≈øelf, and this is the highe≈øt exaltation and expectation of the Saints, contrived by the Wi≈ødom of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed by the Death and Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt, and his being ≈øet down at the right hand of Glory for us.</p>
            <p>This ≈øuperexcellent ≈øtate of the Saints Glory, and Eternal Happine≈øs; is branched out in a fivefold
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65284:141"/> con≈øideration. Fir≈øt, In their ble≈ø≈øed Death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Their Spiritual and Immortal Bodies. Thirdly, Their being admitted into the Pre≈øence of God and Ho≈øt of Heaven. Fourthly, Their being continued in that ≈øtate for ever.

            <p>Fir≈øt, Man in his fir≈øt Creation was made Lord of all Creatures; and tho' after his Fall, by the Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and infinite Love of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, was reconciled to God by a new Covenant of Peace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthele≈øs was continued in a Pri≈øon of Clay, ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected not only to all Natural weakne≈øs, ≈øickne≈øs, cold, hunger, thir≈øt, and other natural infirmities of the Fle≈øh, and unea≈øine≈øs of Life; but al≈øo while in the body, obnoxious to the Temptations of Sin, and grief of Soul, through the weakne≈øs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, under the clog and coverture of the Fle≈øh, as the experience of all Men Witne≈øs, that this Life is but Labour and Sorrow; therefore the Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs of God, and love of Chri≈øt Je≈øus, hath ≈øo contrived that the Soul (a Pri≈øoner) to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery and infirmities, ≈øhould have the Chains of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality knocked off by Death, and be let free to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And this is the fir≈øt ≈øtep of Saints effectual Happine≈øs. The Holy Apo≈øtle clearly te≈øtifieth, that whil≈øt we are in the Body we are ab≈øent from the Lord, and therefore not only we but the whole Creation groan under the≈øe Infirmities, and long for the Liberty of the Sons of God, even the Redemption of our Bodies: and therefore it's revealed that Death is as it were the opening of the Pri≈øon Door, to the Pri≈øoners of Hope, to ≈øet them at liberty from all the mi≈øeries of Mortality and Temptations to ≈øin, and gives them a free Pa≈øs to the Land of Re≈øt. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the Dead thy dye in the Lord, they cea≈øe from their Labours and their Works follow them.</hi> Rev. 14.13. And this is a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65284:141"/> great Con≈øolation to Believers, for as Death is the end of all Fle≈øhly plea≈øures, it's al≈øo the end of all ≈øin and Mi≈øery, ≈øo the way of Death and the Grave ought not to be loath≈øom or irk≈øom to them, for that Chri≈øt the Captain of our Salvation hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both ways, and for us led Captivity Captive, O Death where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy Victory? and the la≈øt Enemy is Death, who is led Captive by Je≈øus Chri≈øt, he will ≈øwallow up Death into Victory, he will Ran≈øom them from the power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death.

            <p>The Second in≈øtance of Eternal Happine≈øs, is to have Spiritual Bodies. The glory of Heaven and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God, which is Eternal Happine≈øs, being de≈øigned for the Saints, therefore the Lord in his Eternal Wi≈ødom, hath contrived and fitted them for it; for as Fle≈øh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, nor Corruption Incorruption, ≈øo the Lord doth provide his Saints Spiritual and Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Bodies, capable to receive the≈øe Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øtations of his Glory, and of Chri≈øt, and all the Heavenly Ho≈øt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. read all.</p>
            <p>As this is an Eminent In≈øtance of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, that Believers ≈øhall be Cloathed with Spiritual Bodies, like that of Chri≈øts, ≈øo it may Mini≈øter great Con≈øolation to Afflicted Mi≈øers, that the time doth not only ha≈øten, in which they ≈øhall be delivered from Mi≈øery, but that al≈øo they ≈øhall have Bodies incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>The third Eminent in≈øtance of this Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, is to be admitted into the Fellow≈øhip of Chri≈øt, and all the Heavenly Ho≈øt, that they may be with me, where I am, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.24.

            <p>Secondly, We ≈øee in Natural Mans De≈øcription, what a ≈ølippery thing he is, and the meanne≈øs of his Condition, and where all with him ends; but the Enjoyments of the New Covenant, is the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all things which peri≈øh not, nor change, <hi>Ro.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To this New Covenant belong Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which make Happine≈øs here, and Eternally hereafter, by all which the Fellows of this Covenant are endowed with the greate≈øt priviledges, and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øted with the Riche≈øt promi≈øes that infinite Wi≈ødom, and Goodne≈øs, thought fit to make a happy State here, and Eternally hereafter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The excellency of this Covenant is ≈øuch, that the priviledges thereto belonging, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and ≈øecures the Heirs of this Covenant again≈øt all vici≈ø≈øitudes in this Life, and fits and moulds them for the Enjoyment of that Eternal State, provided and ≈øecured by this New Covenant, the infinite Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs of God, de≈øigning to make Believers, Citizens of the New <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> made without Hands,

            <p>Although of Gods free Will and Plea≈øure for his own glory, without the nece≈ø≈øity of any further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Man was at fir≈øt Created by God, &amp; as the free love of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, is the only Ri≈øe of Mans Eternal Happine≈øs; neverthele≈øs it is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by Election, but al≈øo by Regeneration, and newne≈øs of Life in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; and by being made Holy, as God is Holy, and therefore the whole frame of the elect, as well of Soul as Body, is changed into the likene≈øs of Chri≈øt in Spirit and Body, If any Man be in Chri≈øt, he is a New Creature, all things are made New, and old things are done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 17.</p>
            <p>That you put off the Old Man which is corrupt according to the Deceitful Lu≈øts, and that you put on the New Man, which after God is Created in Righteou≈øne≈øs and True Holine≈øs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>That ≈øuch fa≈øhioning and change mu≈øt be before the Elect can fully be admitted into the pre≈øence of God, and enjoy him unchangeably, may appear by the≈øe rea≈øons;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, for that the Wi≈ødom and Goodne≈øs of God, intending to compleat Mans Happine≈øs, and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Mi≈øtery of his love, by their immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him≈øelf in the Spiritual, Clear, and full pre≈øence of glory, <hi>That they may be one with me, ≈øee me, and behold my glory,</hi> Jo. 17.24.</p>
            <p>The Communication of Gods glory being ≈øo ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely ≈øpiritual, and not apprehendible, but by the≈øe who are purely ≈øpiritual, therefore our dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding mu≈øt be made ≈øpiritual, The Natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,

            <p>Secondly, Divine Wi≈ødom knowing how Earthly mindedne≈øs runs after the Creature, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therewith, is clog'd from thir≈øting after God, and things ≈øpiritual; to be Carnally minded is Death, but to be ≈øpiritually minded, is Life and Peace, for that they who are after the fle≈øh, do mind the things of the fle≈øh, but they who are after the ≈øpirit, the things of the ≈øpirit, becau≈øe the Carnal mind is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again≈øt God, for it is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And therefore to wean their Hearts from the World, and to wind up the Affections of the elect to him≈øelf, it behoveth their frame to be made ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt gives this as his Command to his Di≈øciples, to be ≈øpiritually minded, and to mind Heavenly Trea≈øures which are not Corruptible, and u≈øeth this Argument, for where your Trea≈øure is, there will your Hearts be al≈øo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord Je≈øus making his People of a Heavenly and Spiritual frame, chiefly to mind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Spiritual things, ≈øets their Affections more earne≈øtly on him≈øelf, di≈øengages them to Human Enjoyments, Reconciles them to Afflictions, and makes them more ea≈øie under the Cro≈øs. If in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> experience, that all the World is but Labour and Sorrow, and Death is more to be de≈øired than Life, how much more ea≈øier will the Affections of the renewed be under all Di≈øappointments of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, when with the Apo≈øtle, they look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65284:146"/> and the in≈øeparable and everla≈øting Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, will they not count all things but Dung and Lo≈øs in Compare with the Excellencies of Chri≈øt? <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.18. For I reckon that the ≈øufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Life, are not worthy to be compared to the glory which ≈øhall be revealed in us. And in that other Famous Scripture, for our Light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, work for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and an Eternal weight of glory, whil≈øt we look not after things which are ≈øeen, but after things which are not ≈øeen, for things which are ≈øeen are Temporal, but things which are not ≈øeen, Eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p>Hence we ≈øee how great is the goodne≈øs and wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God towards renewed Mortals, intreating them with ≈øo great Mercy and Love, in convincing them of the vanity of Earthly ≈øhadows, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to them, that ≈øo High, Deep, Long; and Broad Mi≈øtery of Love in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, which pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth knowledge, and the Riches of the glory of that Mi≈øtery, which is Chri≈øt the hope of all glory, made manife≈øt in the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.26, 27.</p>
            <p>And by their choice of the≈øe excellencies above the Creatures, to make all things el≈øe, to be e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no value, and in their Souls de≈øire, to Eccho <hi>forth none but Chri≈øt,</hi> and having ≈øo ≈øpiritualized their minds, that they can neither Touch, Handle, Smell, or delight in any thing but him, and what tends to his glory, and their Enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the framing of the Saints Bodies at the Re≈øurrection, in a Spiritual and Incorruptible Body, for Chri≈øts de≈øigning not only Mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from wrath to come, but al≈øo to make them Coheirs, and participate with him of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>John</hi> 17.22.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65284:147"/>
            <p>And in re≈øpect, the frame of our Carnal and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Bodies, is not capable to receive that glory, nor to continue under the Enjoyment of it, for that fle≈øh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of glory, nor Corruption inherit Incorruption, he therefore changeth that Corruption into Incorruption, and makes Mortality put on Immortality, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our vile Bodies into the fa≈øhion of his glorious Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, to 55. according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereby he is able to ≈øubdue all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, <hi>Phi.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>What then can or will be wanting, to compleat the Eternal Happine≈øs of the Saints, ≈øeeing they have ≈øo ≈øure a Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>What then remains for the Pri≈øoners of Hope, but to ≈øit down &amp; admire the Heighth, Depth, Length and Breadth of that Incomprehen≈øible Mi≈øtery of the Love of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 18, 19. and by Faith, Love, and Patience, to ≈øit down under his ≈øhadow with great Delight, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2. and again≈øt all Cro≈ø≈øes, Temptations, and Difficulties to take Comfort in the Faith of Eternal Happine≈øs, there is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who walk not after the Fle≈øh, but after the Spirit, if God be for us, who can be again≈øt us, who ≈øhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Ju≈øtifieth, who is he that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, it is Chri≈øt that Dyed; yea, rather that is ri≈øen again? who is even at the right Hand of God, who al≈øo maketh Interce≈ø≈øion for us; who ≈øhall ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of Chri≈øt? I am per≈øwaded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65284:147"/> nor Powers, nor any other Creature, ≈øhall be able to ≈øeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ≈øaid, we ≈øee Believers firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtated to the Title of Joynt Heirs of glory with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and in a firm Covenant through him with the Father, and having ≈øo fair an intere≈øt at ≈øtake, their Duty is to pur≈øue the ≈øame with Faith, Courage, and Patience, and their great prize is not to be had, but by a continued warfare, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is taken by violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ≈øee in the foregoing Doctrine of Chri≈øts ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Saints Examples, and Chri≈øts Doctrine of Mortification, Re≈øignation, and patient bearing of the Cro≈øs, that the Chri≈øtians Life is a continued war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; through Tribulation and Per≈øecution, ye mu≈øt enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more incumbent or nece≈ø≈øary to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, than chearfulne≈øs, the chearful Champion gives glory to the cau≈øe, and a≈ø≈øi≈øts the fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers expectation of Victory, quickneth Actions, and the glory of Victory hoped for makes Combatants di≈øpi≈øe all Difficulties; if then in common Warfare, which is only for Worldly Honour, Riches, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt (which when obtained) peri≈øh in the u≈øing, the chearfulne≈øs be requi≈øite, much more in the War for Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>In this warfare the Combatants have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon than any others. Fir≈øt, For that the prize fought for is eternal happine≈øs. Secondly, The Victory they fight for, is that which Chri≈øt hath already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for them, to wit, their Eternal Salvation, and De≈øtruction of Death and the Devil; <hi>Chri≈øt is crowned with glory and honour, he brings many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If in the common ca≈øe of War, Courage and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs be a nece≈ø≈øary duty, much more in this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian warfare for the≈øe three rea≈øons:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Chri≈øtians of all Warriours, have the mo≈øt excellent priviledges, promi≈øes, and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is Chri≈øts honour to fight chearfully, under his Banner, in imitation of him≈øelf, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Saints.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They have Chri≈øts Command for chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fighting. In all Warfare the≈øe three things are to be con≈øidered,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Whether the War be offen≈øive or defen≈øive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The cau≈øe of the War.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Means, Provi≈øions, and Allies, to Pro≈øecute and Defend the War.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Chri≈øtians War, is both Offen≈øive and Defen≈øive.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Defen≈øive: The melancholy recital of the Annals of Mans Creation and fir≈øt E≈øtate, and how he fell from the Original Righteou≈øne≈øs he was Created in, and that afterward enmity was ≈øowed between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, and a continual warfare, ≈øo as <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ≈øhall brui≈øe Mans Heel, and Man the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. demon≈øtrates to us that here is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare denounced from enmity never to be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Man being lo≈øt in <hi>Adam,</hi> of Gods Free Will, Chri≈øt the Mediator of the new Covenant is early promi≈øed; this is the Covenant of Grace; <hi>By Grace ye are ≈øaved, and not of works, ye are Sons and Heirs of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Promi≈øe,</hi> Eph. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. chap. 2.5.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:65284:148"/>
            <p>Hence ari≈øeth this inte≈øtine War between the Creatures, the Seed of the Woman, which are the Heirs of this Covenant and Elect in Chri≈øt, and the Seed of the old Enemy the Devil, which in all Ages are of the World, and Emi≈ø≈øaries of Satan to <hi>Per≈øecute the Woman and her Child, and ≈øpew forth floods of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution on the Godly,</hi> Rev. 12. to 11.</p>
            <p>Hence we ≈øee how this continued War is laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of the World: It appearing that Mans Enemy is the Devil, his Emi≈ø≈øaries the World, and the Fle≈øh, who are no incon≈øiderable Enemies. <hi>We wre≈øtle not again≈øt Fle≈øh and Blood, but again≈øt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, again≈øt Spiritual wickedne≈ø≈øes in High Places, again≈øt the Rulers of Darkne≈øs of this World,</hi> Eph. 6.12. This Enemy el≈øewhere is called the Prince of the Power of the Air, and is cloathed with all mi≈øchievous qualifications to fight.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He is cloathed with ≈øubtilty and lying, by which at fir≈øt he deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> and by the Apo≈øtle his Temptations are called, <hi>Wiles of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is powerful, <hi>He is the Prince of the Power of the Air, that ruleth in the Children of Di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 2.2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is re≈øtle≈øs and vigilant, <hi>going about night and day, ≈øeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, His Malice is unplacable, ≈øee how he pur≈øueth <hi>Job</hi> from time to time, with fal≈øe in≈øinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God again≈øt him, <hi>Job</hi> 1. to 12. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. to 7.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, His Courage and Boldne≈øs is undaunted he dare tempt the Lord of Glory with impudently renewed Temptations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. to 10.</p>
            <p>He pur≈øueth the Woman and Child Chri≈øt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, and ≈øpeweth forth great floods of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution to de≈øtroy them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. to 11.</p>
            <p>He fights again≈øt the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.</p>
            <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65284:149"/>
            <p>This warfare is both defen≈øive and offen≈øive.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Defen≈øive: In all Wars the Defen≈øive is mo≈øt favourable, nothing being more ju≈øt and natural than to defend ones own right, intere≈øt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and in the Chri≈øtians ca≈øe mo≈øt ju≈øtifyable and nece≈ø≈øary, for Satan the fir≈øt old and continued E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Mankind, having fir≈øt invaded mans quiet and felicity, and tempted him, to break Covenant with God, and continually envying Mans better e≈øtate in the new Covenant re≈øts not to a≈ø≈øault him, and endeavour to ruine him a ≈øecond time, <hi>As he that was born after the Fle≈øh per≈øecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4, 29. So it is now, and this enmity of brui≈øing mans Heel is put upon him as a Judgment for tempting, and upon man as a puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his yielding to the lying and treacherous in≈øinuations under the cunning and ≈øpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øions of Mans advantage, that Man ≈øhould know more, and better; but his malicious intention was to ruine Man with God Eternally.</p>
            <p>Have Chri≈øtians then ≈øo powerful an Enemy, cunning, malicious and vigilant, who is always on his Po≈øt to de≈øtroy, and have they ≈øo con≈øiderable an Intere≈øt at Stake, how doth it then behove them to <hi>≈øtand fa≈øt to the liberty wherewith Chri≈øt hath made them free, and not to be weary in well doing, for if we faint not, we ≈øhall reap in due ≈øea≈øon?</hi> Gal. 5.1. chap. 6.9.</p>
            <p>Is any thing more worth conte≈øting for, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of defence, than that great advantage of being redeemed from wrath to come, and title of honour to ≈øit on the Throne of Chri≈øt, and be heirs of all things, which is not given to the lazy, but to the diligent and victorious. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to ≈øit on my Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.12, 21. We mu≈øt not ≈ølumber but be vigilant; <hi>Ye are the Children of Light and of the Day, not of the Night and Darkne≈øs,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65284:149"/> therefore let us not ≈øleep as do others, watch therefore putting on the whole Armour of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This War is offen≈øive, All Wars though at fir≈øt but defen≈øive, turn for the mo≈øt part to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øive, for that injuries may be ≈øo done by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that provoke the attacked to become an agre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor, not only for reparation, and ≈øatisfaction, but upon ≈øucce≈øs in defence to invade the fir≈øt agre≈ø≈øor, to confine him to ≈øuch limits, as he may not for the future, be capable of doing further injury; and thus of nece≈ø≈øity it mu≈øt be in the Chri≈øtian Warfare, again≈øt Satan, the World and the Fle≈øh, ≈øo that this War is founded upon ≈øuch implacable enmity, that it mu≈øt be continued without hope or expectation of any peace, end, or terms of accommodation, for the≈øe three rea≈øons;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Soveraigns of this War are of Intere≈øts incompatible, ≈øo that of nece≈ø≈øity the victory mu≈øt turn to one ≈øide, before the War can be ended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Parties and Combatants are under different and incompatible Laws, ≈øo can never be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All terms of Treaty or Capitulation, are by command forbid in this War.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Soveraigns of this War are of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Intere≈øt, and therefore the War mu≈øt be perpetual until one of the Parties be de≈øtroyed.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt is the Generali≈ø≈øimo of the Chri≈øtians Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Satan the Mammon of this World, the Fle≈øh and Lu≈øts thereof makes up the competition; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible then mu≈øt it be, with the right glory, honour and intere≈øt; of Chri≈øt, who in his own right is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> to ≈øuffer a Rival to his Inheritance: though for his wi≈øe ends, he let Satan loo≈øe for a while, to tempt and ≈øift the Nations, and draw the Children of Darkne≈øs into ≈ønares and di≈øtruction, and to try the Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65284:150"/> of Gods own People in which the wicked Men are Gods ≈øervants and in≈øtruments; however, to ≈øuffer their power to prevail, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incon≈øi≈øtent with the ab≈øolute power, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and although Satan and his Emi≈ø≈øaries have fought many Battels again≈øt Chri≈øt and his Church, they have ≈øtill been overcome in all of them, and ≈øhall be overcome until Chri≈øt bring Judgment into Victory and overcome him, who hath the power of Death, even the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. to 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 17.14. Oh Death I will be thy Plagues, O Grave, I will be thy De≈øtruction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ≈øhall be hid from mine Eyes, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 13.14. Death is ≈øwallowed up into Victory; O Death where is thy ≈øting O Grave where is thy Victory, the Sting of Death is Sin, and the ≈øtrength of Sin is the Law, but thanks be to God who hath given us the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, to 56.</p>
            <p>The Lord of Life hath told us, we cannot ≈øerve God and Mammon, we mu≈øt reject the one, if we ≈øerve the other, ≈øo that their Intere≈øt being incon≈øi≈øtent we mu≈øt onely be of one ≈øide, there is no fellow≈øhip between God and Belial: So that they cannot divide Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øts, therefore there is a nece≈ø≈øity to be on Chri≈øts ≈øide; The Son of the Bond Woman which is Sin and Satan, the World and Lu≈øts thereof cannot Inherit with the Son of the Free Woman, which is Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Combatants of the≈øe two Armies, have different and incon≈øi≈øtent Laws, and the≈øe Laws are ≈øo relative and in ≈øuch affinity, with the ≈øeveral intere≈øts of the Soveraigns, that of nece≈ø≈øity perpetuates the War, ≈øo as no end can be expected, except by ab≈øolute victory of one or other ≈øide.</p>
            <p>All Chri≈øts Soldiers are new Creatures, renewed in the Spirit of their Mind, have the ≈øame Mind in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65284:150"/> them which was in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, are under Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Holy Laws, ≈øubject to his Will according to that Portion of his Spirit, which he hath given them, ≈øpiritually not carnally minded, walk and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of the Spirit, and not of the Law of the Fle≈øh; they are not led with <hi>malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, envyings, ≈ølanderings, back-bitings, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and cruelties, which are the works of the Fle≈øh,</hi> Gal. 4.19, 20, 21. But they are led after the Laws of the Spirit, and live in all <hi>gentlene≈øs, meekne≈øs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, charity, and kindne≈øs, as the works of the Spirit,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.19. Ephe≈ø. 4.22, to end. Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, the≈øe under Antichri≈øts Banner, neither are nor can be ≈øubject to the Laws of the Spirit, for they are of the Fle≈øh, and live after the Fle≈øh; <hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, becau≈øe the carnal Mind is enmity again≈øt God, for it is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, ≈øo that they which are in the fle≈øh cannot plea≈øe God,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Fle≈øh Lu≈øteth again≈øt the Spirit, and the Spirit again≈øt the Fle≈øh, and the≈øe are contrary one to the other,</hi> Gal. 5.17. So we ≈øee that the Laws of the≈øe pretenders to Dominion are ≈øo oppo≈øite to one another, that it is impo≈ø≈øible to reconcile them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third thing which perpetuates this War, is that no treaty, capitulation, or agreement, can be between the≈øe parties, this enmity is ≈øo laid by God him≈øelf, that Satan mu≈øt brui≈øe Mans Heel, and the Seed of the Woman mu≈øt brui≈øe Satans Head, to the end of the World; Such enmity is between God and Mammon, that the love of the one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øervice of the other. <hi>Know ye not that the Friend≈øhip of this World is enmity to God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever therefore will be a Friend to the World is the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. <hi>Love not the World nor the things

            <p>Thus the Intere≈øts and Laws of the≈øe two parties, being ≈øo incon≈øi≈øtent, there is no Room for any treaty, hopes or po≈ø≈øibility of accommodation; for that the Spiritual Man, hath antipathy to the Lu≈øts of the Fle≈øh, and the Carnal Man cannot be ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of holine≈øs, becau≈øe of the enmity of his mind; and therefore the holy Apo≈øtle is ≈øo far from accommodating the matter, between Lu≈øt and Holine≈øs, Fle≈øh and the Spirit, that he would not have the Spiritual Man to keep any Communication with the unfruitful works of Darkne≈øs; <hi>What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low≈øhip hath God with</hi> Belial, <hi>a clean thing with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; who can touch pitch and not be defiled therewith? evil communication corrupts good manners;</hi> Wherefore he forbids all tampering with the ≈øpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of the World or Earthly things. <hi>Wherefore if ye be dead with Chri≈øt from the rudiments of the World, why as though living in the World are ye ≈øubject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? ta≈øte not, touch not, handle not the≈øe things, all which peri≈øh in the u≈øing, after the Doctrine and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men,</hi> Col. 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> in another place is more ≈øevere, where he commends the Repentance not to be repented of, and in the effects of ≈øorrow and repentance he ≈øaith, <hi>Behold this ≈øelf ≈øame thing that ye ≈øorrowed after a Godly manner, what carefulne≈øs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ≈øelves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement de≈øire, yea what revenge, yea what zeal?</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. In which we ≈øee what expre≈ø≈øions of vehement zeal again≈øt corruption and ≈øin, which are the works of the Fle≈øh, by the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions, vehement de≈øire, indignation and revenge is implied, ≈øuch implacable di≈øpo≈øition, that nothing can ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy except a total ruine and exterpation of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65284:151"/> and their adherents in root and branch, and thus it mu≈øt be with Chri≈øtians, they mu≈øt not be Neuters, or luke-warm, but mu≈øt be mortified to the fle≈øh and the Body of Death, Corruption and Sin mu≈øt be ≈øo ≈øubdued in them that they mu≈øt be Dead to the World, and the World to them, ≈øo as they can take no more plea≈øure therein, than the living can have in the Dead, with which they can have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. <hi>I am Crucified to the World; and the World to me, neverthele≈øs I live, but not I; and the life that I live in the Fle≈øh, is by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. chap. 5.24.</p>
            <p>Hence we ≈øee all the Combatants <hi>of Chri≈øt</hi> are wholly his, and not divided, and can by no means Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with the Enemies of his Cro≈øs, the Devil, the World, and the Fle≈øh, and this is their indi≈øpen≈øable and commanded duty, that they mu≈øt fight till they overcome, for to ≈øuch alone is the prize of Eternal Life; <hi>He that overcometh ≈øhall ≈øit with me in my Fathers Kingdom, even as I overcame and am ≈øet down with my Father in his Kingdom,</hi> Rev. 3.21.</p>
            <p>They mu≈øt live to the Spirit, and not to the Fle≈øh, with that holy fear over them≈øelves, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Eye on the Enemies Camp, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again≈øt Sin and the Fle≈øh, that they <hi>may not again return to their folly,</hi> and that they may place no Earthly thing in their Hearts above Chri≈øt, and all the days of their appointed time they mu≈øt wait till their change come.</p>
            <p>As this Chri≈øtian warfare is continuing, and mu≈øt only end with our lives, we are to con≈øider for our encouragement, that Chri≈øt doth not leave Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unprovided for ≈øuch great expedients, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides them a great Train of Artillery, as the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaries of their warfare, which is held forth to us in that de≈øcription of the Armour of the Spirit by the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65284:152"/> Apo≈øtle, put on the whole Armour of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eph. 6.13, to 19.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Loyns girt with Truth; which is inward ≈øincerity and con≈øtant loyalty to the Cau≈øe of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Brea≈øt-Plate of Righteou≈øne≈øs, to be blamele≈øs and of upright conver≈øation towards God, and to avoid ≈øcandal to the wicked, and be an example of Ju≈øtice and Godline≈øs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Feet ≈øhod with the preparation of the Go≈øpel of Peace, to be peaceable, charitable, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and meek, and conformable to the Laws of the Spirit, and not of the Fle≈øh.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Shield of Faith, believing God in his Attributes of Omnipotency, Holine≈øs, Ju≈øtice, Goodne≈øs and Faithfulne≈øs, and in Je≈øus Chri≈øt as the Saviour of the World, in all his Promi≈øes and Providences, by which we may be able to re≈øi≈øt the fiery Darts of Satan, in an≈øwering all objections of unbelief and di≈øcouragements from Temptations in the World.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Helmet of Salvation; to believe that Eternal Life is the prize, at the end of the Chri≈øtian race, and this is cure again≈øt all Trials, from want, or difficulties, in the Way to Heaven, to be as a≈ø≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Eternal Life, as we are cloathed with that Helmet of Defence; <hi>It is Chri≈øt that died who ≈øhall condemn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Praying and Watching as good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, on their Po≈øts waiting for the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to march at all times after the General and Captain of our Salvation Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and to be ready with Oyl in our Ve≈ø≈øels, and Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting for the approach of the Bridegroom, to enter into the Marriage fea≈øt of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Thus ≈øeeing this War is con≈øtant, and for the greate≈øt prize, even Eternal Life, and though again≈øt the mo≈øt Potent Enemies, Principalities, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65284:152"/> Wickedne≈ø≈øes, in High Places, yet Chri≈øt the unconquerable Champion is Captain, and the Camp is furni≈øhed with ≈øuch compleat warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, Chri≈øtians ought to fight chearfully, for the≈øe following rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Salvation and Eternal Happine≈øs is the prize contended for.</p>
            <p>And we have Chri≈øts Promi≈øe if we fight in Faith, and continue to the end, we ≈øhall obtain it, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we are to fight and contend for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, ≈øo it is not only promi≈øed to us on our chearful fighting, but it is al≈øo obtained for us by Chri≈øt, who on the Cro≈øs fought that good fight, and freely gives us the booty, and prize, when we were not capable to do any thing for our ≈øelves, <hi>For when we were yet without ≈øtrength, in due time Chri≈øt died for the ungodly, God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chri≈øt died for us; much more then being now ju≈øtified by his Blood, we ≈øhall be ≈øaved from wrath through him,</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8, 9. Ezek. 16. to 9.</p>
            <p>This is that great bait for ambition and de≈øire, this is that all, which ≈øhould ≈øwell the Thoughts and Affections of all Men.</p>
            <p>This rightly con≈øidered is ≈øufficient to invite all Courage, Patience, and new Obedience; to fill all Hearts with Joy, gladne≈øs, and thank≈øgiving, and ≈øtifle all murmurings, repinings and di≈øcontents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trials or difficulties of worldly concerns, and in our Way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>This ≈øhould induce all to a hearty ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the yoak and chearful fighting under Chri≈øts Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Combatants of Chri≈øt have the greate≈øt booty, rewards and priviledges that any Soldiers can pretend unto, and that both of Spirituals and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65284:153"/> Temporals, and tho≈øe Spirituals are in many re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They are under an everla≈øting Covenant with God, and God with them, I will make with them an everla≈øting Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27, 29. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 60.20, 21. <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 59.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They have remi≈ø≈øion of all ≈øins, though of the highe≈øt and blacke≈øt Nature, though never ≈øo numerous, and as a Cloud or a thick Cloud, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>ch.</hi> 44.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They have comfort in Spiritual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and De≈øertion, their ca≈øe can never be ≈øo cloudy, melancholly, and dark to them, but Gods word hath a promi≈øe for it, <hi>Light is ≈øowen to the righteous, and joy to the upright in Heart,</hi> I≈øa. 50.10. Mal. 3.12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are Heirs of all things, and ≈øhall inherit all things, they have the Promi≈øe of the things of this Life, and of that which is to come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They ≈øhall be united to God in Chri≈øt, in Spirit, Knowledge and Glory, and be in≈øeparable from him in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, to 25.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They ≈øhall be ≈øet down with Chri≈øt and God in Glory, and continue with them for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 38, 39. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. Thus we ≈øee the unque≈øtionable Spiritual advantages of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which no other Intere≈øt can bring, and as the Saints advantages and excellencies are Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øible as to Spirituals, ≈øo the ≈øecurity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are no le≈øs in Temporals, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this Treati≈øe di≈øcovered.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In general,</p>
            <p>Secondly, His Promi≈øes in all particular ca≈øes, As</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In Sickne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Impri≈øonment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Poverty.</p>
            <pb n="281" facs="tcp:65284:153"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Under the unkindne≈øs and for≈øaking of Friends.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Under reproaches.</p>
            <p>This great promi≈øe of general and particular a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance, and ≈øo many great priviledges being the fir≈øt ground of Chri≈øtian encouragement.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is, That they have the example of Chri≈øt, his Prophets and Saints in Heaven, who have with undaunted courage, chearfulne≈øs, and patience, fought that good fight and have received their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>As it is great happine≈øs in any warfare to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wi≈øe, able and experienced Commanders, and as the fame of the Captain rai≈øeth Courage and hope of Victory, ≈øo it is much more in this Chri≈øtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, where Chri≈øt is General and the Saints in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are examples.</p>
            <p>Who≈øe Courage, Wi≈ødom, or Power, can be comparable to Chri≈øts, who is Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.1. who is power infinite, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. and for his experience he is the antient of days.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He is Wi≈ødom it ≈øelf, wi≈ødom is his ≈øtile and name, and well it may be ≈øo, for by his wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He made all things, and by him≈øelf he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things; <hi>He is the Image of the Invi≈øible God, and in whom dwelleth all Power and the Godhead bodily,</hi> Heb. 1. to 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is infinite in Power, and <hi>there is no ≈øearching of his under≈øtanding, he hath mea≈øured the Waters in the hollow of his hand, he metted out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his Span, and comprehended the Du≈øt of the Earth in a Mea≈øure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, The Nations are before him as a drop of a Bucket; and are counted as the ≈ømall Du≈øt of a Ballance, he taketh up the Hills as a very little thing,</hi> Job 32.8. ch. 38. ch. 39. I≈øa. 40.12, to 16.</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:65284:154"/>
            <p>Thirdly, For Experience, he is the Antient of days, the Fir≈øt-Born of every Creature, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga:</hi> ≈øee that Di≈øcription given him by <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wi≈øe≈øt of Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>He is not only Wi≈øe, and Wi≈ødom him≈øelf, but he is Wi≈ødom diffu≈øive to others, gives them not only the precepts of Wi≈ødom, but doth infu≈øe Wi≈ødom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and maketh them docile and quick in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding, and in this he exceeds all other Captains and Teachers, who may in≈øtruct, but cannot form the under≈øtanding, as he doth, <hi>I will pour my Spirit on you, I will make known my words unto you,</hi> Pro. 1.23. John. 1. to 6. I≈øa. 61.1. He is the Spirit of Wi≈ødom, inlightning the World, he is ≈øent of the Father, and hath of him received the Spirit, to Communicate Wi≈ødom to others.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Almighty giveth him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, this Wi≈ødom is ≈øuch as excelleth, becau≈øe it is of Chri≈øts own Spirit, Pure Truth, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pure as Gold, yea, purer than much fine Gold: ≈øee the excellent vertue of Gods Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions, Converting the Soul, Enlightning the eyes, Clean, True, Righteous, Sweet, In≈øtructing, and in keeping of them there, is great reward, and endure for ever, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 19.7, to 1.</p>
            <p>This Wi≈ødom is the fear of God, from whence it hath its ri≈øe, and how excellent and de≈øirous this is, ≈øee <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. and all <hi>ch.</hi> 8. all, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. in which are made out all advantages, both Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
            <p>See what account the Holy Prophet makes of this Wi≈ødom and Knowledge of God, above all Human Knowledge, or of things Earthly; let not the Rich Man glory in his Riches, nor the Wi≈øe Man in his Wi≈ødom, nor the Strong Man in his Strength, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, ≈øaith the Lord, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65284:154"/> he under≈øtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exerci≈øeth loving kindne≈øs, Judgment and Righteou≈øne≈øs in the Earth, for in the≈øe things I delight, ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p>The Holy Evangeli≈øt te≈øtifieth of this Wi≈ødom, <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee, and whom thou ha≈øt ≈øent, Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> Jo. 17.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apo≈øtle al≈øo declares, what this Wi≈ødom is, even Je≈øus Chri≈øt, <hi>Who of God is made unto us Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteou≈øne≈øs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ≈øecond qualification of this great Chri≈øtian General in his power, joyned with what is already ≈øaid, he is infinite in power, He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. he is the Ble≈ø≈øed and only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. He is the mo≈øt High, and ruleth in the Kingdom of the Earth, and giveth them to whom≈øoever he plea≈øeth; of his Kingdom there ≈øhall be no end; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33.</p>
            <p>He poureth Contempt on Princes, and cau≈øeth them to wander in the Wilderne≈øs, where there is no way, yet ≈øetteth he the poor on High, and maketh him Families like a Flock, <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 107.40, 41.</p>
            <p>He can make Nations as ≈øtubble, and Kings of the Earth as nothing, he makes wa≈øt Mountains and Hills, and dryeth up all the Rivers; he can make Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, I≈ølands, and dry upon the Pools; he can lead the Blind, the way they know not, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 42.15, 16.</p>
            <p>He can make Darkne≈øs Light, and Crooked things Straight, he can form Light, and Create Darkne≈øs, he can make Peace, and Create War, <hi>I≈ø.</hi> 45.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third quality of this great General, is his great Experience, Conduct and Valour.</p>
            <p>Can the Antient of Days, who hath Conquered and Subdued all he ever Encountered with, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Victory on his ≈øide? had not he the better of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65284:155"/> Old Enemy the Devil, who beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and for his lying and pre≈øumption, Condemned him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Enmity and Contempt?</p>
            <p>Did he not Conquer <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Pride and ≈øtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs by Plagues, and overthrow him wholly at la≈øt?</p>
            <p>Did he not ≈øignalize his Power, Fame, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs towards his People of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> in De≈øtroying their Enemies, and appearing for them in all the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their afflicted Conditions, ≈øee the great Series of his Care of them.</p>
            <p>Did not he overthrow the Devil, when under Temptation of Hunger, and would not work a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for his own Relief; but Preached up Faith, on the Word and Power of God? <hi>Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4.2.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Did not he when Tempted from Scripture, to tru≈øt to Gods Protection, in throwing of him≈øelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, reject that In≈øinuation of Satan by Scripture, <hi>Thou mu≈øt not Tempt the Lord thy God, P≈ø.</hi> 71.11. By which he Magnified the Soveraignty of God, and would not Tempt Providence? <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And being Tempted to Wor≈øhip the Devil, for the gain of the World, he defeated the Tempter from the Duty of Wor≈øhipping God only, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt Wor≈øhip the Lord thy God, and him only ≈øhalt thou ≈øerve,</hi> Mat. 4.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly, by his Submi≈ø≈øion to the purpo≈øe, and Will of God on the Cro≈øs, he overcame Death, the la≈øt Enemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.50. <hi>ch.</hi> 28.60. and by his Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Crowned Mans Eternal Happine≈øs, <hi>O Death I will be thy Plague, O Grave, I will be thy De≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Repentance ≈øhall be hid from mine Eyes,</hi> Ho≈øea 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Hence is this Admirable In≈øtance of the Power, of that Champion of our Salvation, who through the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65284:155"/> vail of his own Fle≈øh, hath made Conque≈øt of Eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal Life for us, and by his free Love, Power, and good Will, hath given them the Victory over all his Enemies, and the la≈øt Enemy, Death it ≈øelf, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Sin the Sting of Death, and as the great Trophy of his Victory, hath <hi>Blotted out the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinances, which was again≈øt them, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, and Nailed it to his own Cro≈øs, and ≈øo hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Victory for Believers,</hi> Col. 3.13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>From hence may be ≈øeen, the Truth of that great Mi≈øtery of Gods Love in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, Eye hath not ≈øeen, neither hath Ear heard, <hi>&amp;c. I≈ø.</hi> 64.4. and how great Rea≈øon then have ≈øinful Mortals to be much in the Admiration of all the Dimentions of that inexpre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible Mi≈øtery of Chri≈øts Love, which pa≈ø≈øeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>As the many Advantages from the Booty, in this Conflict, and Chri≈øts Example, is an inducement for chearful fighting, ≈øo is the Example of the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Companions of this Combate, of which ≈øee a great Tribe of the Royal Combatants under this Banner of Chri≈øt, fighting to Death with Immortal Glory, ≈øet down before: the Saints Banner, is the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, <hi>God forbid that I ≈øhould glory in any thing, ≈øave in the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p>In this Cro≈øs or Banner, Chri≈øt carries in it, as the Trophy of his Victory and Motto, for the Comfort of Sinners, that Hand-Writing of Ordinance above mentioned, and this is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Believers, Col. 2.14. <hi>He that Believeth on him, ≈øhall never peri≈øh, but have Eternal Life,</hi> John 3.14, to 18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third Encouragement for chearful fighting, is Chri≈øts expre≈øs Will and Command, <hi>Let not your Hearts be Troubled, you believe in God, believe al≈øo in me,</hi> &amp;c. Jo. 14. <hi>to</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rejoyce always, yea I ≈øay, rejoyce evermore,</hi> Col. 3.16, 17.</p>
