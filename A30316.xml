         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Epiſtle Dedicatory.</hi> To the Right Honourable, Learned and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Sir <hi>Thomas Burnet</hi> of <hi>Leis,</hi> Knight and Baronett, and one of their Majeſties moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council; for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Grace, Peace, and all Happineſs, both Temporal and Eternal.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the Promiſe of the All-Glorious God, to Honour thoſe that Honour him; there be four ſpecial ways, whereby God Honours Men.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When he raiſeth them out of nothing, worſe than nothing, yea, from the very depth of Hell, to a height of Heavenly Honour, Happineſs and Holineſs in Chriſt Jeſus, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes them more Excellent than their Neighbours, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. more Excellent, not in degrees only, but in kind; more Excellent in their Birth, for they are Born again of the Word, and of the Spirit; more Excellent in their Thoughts, more Excellent in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, more Excellent in their Practices, more Excellent in their Lives, in Regard of Gods Favour towards them; and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:65284:3"/> in their Death, their Death is ſweet to them: All True Chriſtians are truly Right Honourable, and Truly Royal: They are Loyal Subjects, and a Royal Prieſt-hood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. They are really the loweſt, yet the higheſt People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. Loweſt in their own Senſe, higheſt in Gods ſight, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and 5.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God Honours Men, when he gives them Hearts to ſerve him, in a Faithful and Fruitful Subjection to his Will. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is not only Duty, but alſo our Priviledge and Preferment. Hence <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Gloryed more in that he was a Servant of Chriſt, than being Emperour of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God Honours Men, when he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Men to places of Eminency above others: And makes them Faithful, in employing their power for God, and Piouſly prudent in their publick Deportment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But the higheſt Honour ſhall be hereafter in Heaven, when the Saints ſhall be filled brim full, with Grace and Glory. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Honour God, until he hath Honoured us: We cannot give glory to God, until we have received glory from him; becauſe he firſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours us; Grace is Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> God hath Honoured your Family, with the Trueſt Honour in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Your Anceſtors have been Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:3"/> for Piety, Virtue, Religion and Zeal to Gods Glory; and God hath made you a Honourable Branch, of that Honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and hath given you a Heart to Honour him again. Some Families are valued from Antiquity, who can pretend Title to Religion or Virtue in themſelves or Anceſtors; but your Honour is truly valuable on both accounts, and indeed from Religion, and Exemplary practice of Godlineſs, the Bleſſing on Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Perſons, is to be expected. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Debauchery, hath lain ſo long on ſome Families, as a Moth, until they are altogether gangren'd; and as the Degeneracy of ſome Families in Religion and Morals, is too, too palpable, it's to be likewiſe feared, their Extirpation may be as Conſpicuous, and it ought to be Matter of Humiliation, that Impiety hath been ſo Predominant, without Parallel, in the late Reigns; From the inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Incouragement at the Helm; that the moſt Conſiderable Families in theſe Nations, have been Sullyed with the blackeſt Stains of Vice, ſo that Morality hath been accounted pedantry, and Religion Bafouned and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed. And it muſt be allowed the Glory, as well as the Mercy of ſome, who have not been carryed away in ſuch a Deluge. And your Honour by the ſpecial Conduct of Providence, hath been preſerved in your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:4"/> as an Exemplary Stock to graft upon, for the future Propagation of Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe following Sheets, being a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the private Meditations of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Born and Educated in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> near to your Honours Antient Mannor of <hi>Crathis;</hi> In his Solitude, when by Providence, he was reſtrained from the Exerciſe of his Talent, in the way of his Profeſſion and Education; and only intended for the uſe of himſelf, and Family. But whilſt in his Confinement, he was viſited by ſome Chriſtian Friends, as well of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, as Civil Profeſſion, and theſe Sheets coming occaſionally to be by them viewed and approved of; The Author was Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to Print the ſame, as containing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particulars, which might tend to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Religion. But for ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he was Averſe; as Firſt, his then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances could not bear the Charge of the Preſs; Secondly, He hath truly obſerved, that the ſincere Affections to Religion in Life and Practice, is ſo decayed, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wrote on that Subject, unleſs varniſhed under the Name of ſome Author Eminently in Vogue, the ſame is implicitly vilified; and he intending not to be known, and conſidering, if known, his Name might not be Authentick, to give Reputation to
<pb facs="tcp:65284:4"/> the Truth of the Writing, however valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it ſelf. Thirdly, That as Books are valued not ſo much for the matter they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as the Fame of the Author, or Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciny of ſome Eminent Perſon, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a loſs, to whom to Dedicate, fearing in this Degeneracy of zeal for God, his Dedication might be conſtrued avarice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than deſire of a Patrone.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sheets lying thus in their Swadling-Cloaths, and like to periſh in Darkneſs, and I being Familiarly acquainted with the Author, and finding that in them the moſt Nervous parts of Practical Relegion, were Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly Treated and Methodized, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Zeal, in Advancing Religion, to Solicite the Authors Permiſſion to Publiſh theſe Sheets; and the rather, for what was his Diſcouragement, in want of Patron, was my Encouragement, that I might Preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Honours Favour on this behalf.</p>
            <p>The Author having appoſitely Intituled this Treatiſe <hi>(The Anatomy of Man)</hi> as being a Series of the whole State of Man, from his Creation, to his Eternal Reſt in Glory, and I having the Happineſs to be ſo well acquainted with your Honours zeal, for the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of your Knowledge in all the Myſtical and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts of Religion, your Serene Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:65284:5"/> to diſtinguiſh, and your Charity to Encourage good Intentions, and Indulge Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, I could no where find a ſafer Sanctuary for <hi>(the Anatomy of Man)</hi> than in your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Protection. Neither could I, without the Violation of greateſt obligations, omit this Oblation to your Honour; and if I may be juſtified from the falſe Imputation of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, I can boldly aver, your Honour is duly Intituled to ſuch Patrociny, not only from the long Series of your Judicious, Juſt, and Honourable Anceſtors; but alſo from your own Exemplary Eſpouſing, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and Encouraging of Religion; and Conſtant, Holy, Affection to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore Right Honourable, through your gentle Hands, I commend this Treatiſe to the World. It is not neceſſary that I ſhould give it an account, why I ſeek ſo far from home! God hath wrought my Heart, to Love thoſe that Love him, and Honour thoſe that Honour him: And diſtance of Place, cannot Abridge my Duty. With all this, I would the World ſhould know, I am one, amongſt thoſe many, who truly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you for your Virtues. In Teſtimony whereof, I make this Dedication to your Worthy Name, and Honourable Perſon, which I beſeech you to accept of, as an
<pb facs="tcp:65284:5"/> Acknowledgment of that Debt I owe, and the unfeigned deſire I have of your Souls Welfare.</p>
            <p>Let theſe Sheets as hopeful Twins, find ſhelter under your Wings, and Protection under your Roof. If your Honour approve of them, and find in them the Anatome of the Title, and that they may be of uſe to the preſent, and after Generations, your Countenance is implored thereunto as a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, which in ſome meaſure, may ſupply Omiſſions or Defects of the Author. And as he is ſond of your Patrociny, and will gratefully acknowledge the Honour of it, I muſt needs own my Renewed Obligations, in the Acceptance of this my Addreſs; and ſhall by Divine Aſſiſtance, never be wanting, to Wiſh and Pray for the Increaſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Grace, Honour, and Proſperity to your ſelf, your Pious, Honourable Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and Zealouſly Religious Lady, and Hopeful Succeſſion, as the indiſpenſable Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of,</p>

            <p>If then the Heavenly Harmony, Union, and joyful Shoutings of the Sons of God, was Raviſhing and Refreſhful, even to ſitting down under that ſhadow with great delight, and being ſick of Love, when Man and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was in its firſt Integrity, when we look
<pb facs="tcp:65284:9"/> on the black and defaced Countenance of Man and Creatures, defiled with all manner of Sin and Pollution, and the World with all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Wickedneſſes and Contention, and being Branded with Gods diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>How great reaſon have we with the Church to cry out, <hi>How is the Gold become Dim; How is the moſt fine Gold changed? and with</hi> David <hi>to ſay, Wo is me, that I So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in</hi> Meſech, <hi>and dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar? Pſ. <hi>120.5.</hi>

            <p>If the Soul of Righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> was grieved at the Iniquity of <hi>Sodom,</hi> how much more Reaſon have Men now adays, to grieve for that univerſal Deluge of Abominations, which overflow the whole, while earth in ſerious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Man in his Integrity, and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Creation, and the preſent Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy under Sin and Miſery, and being Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to underſtand that Myſtery, why the World once approved of God to be good, and given to Man, ſhould afterwards be ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gods Curſe and Diſpleaſure, as in the foregoing Scripture, I was entertained with that of <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Shall Mortal Man be more juſt than God, ſhall a Man be more pure than his Maker, Job. 4.17.</hi> which lead me to enquire into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſes of this great Cataſtrophe, and to underſtand the meaning, together with the
<pb facs="tcp:65284:9"/> Juſtice of God, and the Miſtery of his Love to believers, in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>In this enquiry, I was led up to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gods bounty to Man, by which he was made in the likeneſs of God in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, true Holineſs, and Knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of him that Created him, and had the other Creatures given to him for uſe, with Dominion over them, under the Tenure of his Obedience, and under the Commination and Aſſurance of Death on his Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>I had no ſooner viewed the Happineſs of his firſt Eſtate, when I was led to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of his Tranſgreſſion, by putting forth his Heart to Rebellion, and his Hands to the Treſpaſs, and then found the Judgment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him, by which he was degraded of his Soveraignty, and Enmity was ſown between him and the Creatures, and the Earth accurſed for his ſake, <hi>Gen. 3.14.</hi> to <hi>20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here with the Prophet, we may put the queſtion, is Man the Darling of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, made lately in Gods own Image, and Lord of all the Creation? is he now <hi>a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a Home-born Slave? why is he ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? The Anſwer is in the Text, haſt thou not procured this to thy ſelf, In that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God? for my People have committed two Evils, they have forſaken me, the Fountain of Living Waters,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:10"/> and hewed themſelves Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that can hold no Water,</hi> Jer. <hi>2.11, 13, 14, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And with the ſame Prophet we may cry out with Aſtoniſhment, Be Aſtoniſhed O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and be horribly afraid, be ye very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. <hi>2.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is this Riddle reſolved, <hi>ſhall Mortal Man be more Juſt than God? Shall Man be more pure than his Maker,</hi> Man hath forſaken God, and followed his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, therefore God muſt be juſt, to bring upon him the Judgment threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> the forfeiture of all his Priviledges, and make him ſmart under the folly of his own Devices. <hi>They hatch</hi> Cockatrice <hi>Eggs, and weave the Spiders Webb, he that eateth of their Eggs dyeth, and that which is cruſhed breaketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Viper, their Webb ſhall not become Garments, neither ſhall they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their Works, their Works are Works of Iniquity,</hi> Iſ. <hi>59.5, 6, 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we find God is Juſt, in puniſhing Man for his Tranſgreſſion, and Man by his Folly hath brought himſelf and Poſterity to ruin, who through the Pride of his Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, abode not in his Integrity, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining againſt God, hath brought himſelf and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, under Servitude to Sin, Miſery, and Death.</p>
            <p>Thus while <hi>with</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Children, and refuſing to be Comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:65284:10"/> they were not,</hi> Jer. <hi>31.15.</hi> I was plunged in oppreſſion of Thoughts, and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lamenting, that ſo glorious a Fabrick of Gods Handy-work, as in the firſt Creation, in Holineſs and Integrity ſhould be polluted by Sin, and defaced from the primitive Beauty, and as <hi>Moſes</hi> pleading with God from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of his own Glory and Power, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his People of <hi>Iſrael, Num. 14.11.</hi> to <hi>17.</hi> heartily wiſhing, that glorious and firſt Image might again be reſtored in Man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of him that Created it, I was led to that Scripture, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, ſaith the Lord, for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts,</hi> Iſ. <hi>55.8, 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while muſing what the Spirit meant in theſe Expreſſions, I was carryed back, to review the fatal Record of mans Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sentence for his Rebellion, in which I found written, <hi>And I will put Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed, and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel,</hi> Gen. <hi>3.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being yet more in the dark, as to the meaning of that Scripture, I was led to that of Gods Covenant with <hi>Abraham, and I will Eſtabliſh my Covenant between thee
<pb facs="tcp:65284:11"/> and me, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations for an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Gen. <hi>17.7, 8.</hi> and to that other Word of God to <hi>Moſes, I will raiſe them up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet amongſt their Brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words into his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all the words which I have commanded him,</hi> Deut. <hi>18.18.</hi> And being led a little further, to underſtand the meaning of this, I met with that Word of the Lord to <hi>David,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, And thine Houſe, and thy Kingdom ſhall be Eſtabliſhed for ever before thee, and thy Throne ſhall be Eſtabliſhed for ever, 2</hi> Sam. <hi>7.11, to 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, <hi>The Lord hath Sworn in Truth unto</hi> David, <hi>he will not turn from it, of the Fruit of thy Body will I ſet upon thy Throne,</hi> Pſ. <hi>132.11. And the Lord hath ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou at my Right Hand, until I make thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thy Foot-ſtool,</hi> Pſ. <hi>110.1. and that other place of the ſame Prophet</hi> David, <hi>And thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer thy Holy one to ſee Corruption,</hi> Pſ. <hi>16.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus being led to the view of theſe Scriptures, and being yet more Anxious to underſtand their meaning, I was at laſt, by the Bleſſing of God, led to that of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:65284:11"/> of the <hi>Acts, verſe 22,</hi> to <hi>37.</hi> And that of the 7th. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> And to theſe words, <hi>Of this mans Seed, hath God according to his promiſe, raiſed unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Saviour,</hi> Acts <hi>13.15, to 42.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which I found plainly laid open, that before the Foundations of the Earth were laid, <hi>2 Tim. 1.9.</hi> God according to his own purpoſe, had provided the means of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and that all the foregoing Scriptures under the Old Teſtament, were Prophetical of his Eternal purpoſe, and good Will, and that in the fulneſs of time, he ſhould ſend one, even Jeſus Chriſt, to take upon him the Nature of man, with whom God entred into an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, and that for Sin, Sin ſhould be Condemned in the fleſh, and that Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Prophets ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Eſtabliſhing of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne for ever, are all meant of that Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant between God and Jeſus Chriſt, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> by which Covenant, Chriſt was to come in the fleſh, and ſuffer death as he did, and that he ſhould obtain Eternal Life, for all ſuch as ſhould believe in him, <hi>Jo. 3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus being inſtructed, that the manifold promiſes and priviledges ſpoken of in the Old and New Teſtament, do belong to Believers, and that as well Salvation, as Faith, to lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt, are freely of God as a gift,
<pb facs="tcp:65284:12"/> 
               <hi>Jam. 1.17.</hi> Hence I found the Truth of that of Gods Word, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts;</hi> our thoughts are narrow, and run on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the leſſer things, and would de ſatisfied with the Reſtoration of man, to his firſt Eſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſidering this new and Second Covenant, in the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> not only of things Temporal, but alſo of things Eternal, and that this Second Covenant is Everlaſting, ſure, and not ſubject to the fatal Apoſtacy, as was that in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as in Contemplation of the Happy State of man, in his Firſt Creation, the Heart was raiſed to rejoyce in God, and magnifie his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and could not but take pleaſure in ſo choice a Speculation, and as on reflection upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and decayed condition of man, upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, the Soul muſt needs be dejected with melancholy and grievous thoughts, how highly may the Soul be Elevated with Admiration, of that infinite love of God to mankind, in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath in him, choſen of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, before the Foundation of the World?</hi> Eph. <hi>1.4, 5. having predeſtinated them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Adoption of Children to himſelf,</hi> and properly apply that of the Holy Prophet, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man (beſides thee O Lord) what good things he hath laid up for them, who wait on him,</hi> Iſ. <hi>64.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65284:12"/>
            <p>Thus, Chriſtian Reader, being led unto the meditation of theſe three material Concerns of mans everlaſting condition, I have Collected theſe enſuing Sheets, in which I have firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered mans condition in the Firſt Creation, and Secondly under his Apoſtacy, wherein I have examined, that original Sin in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ingredients thereof, and how far the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity are guilty, and affected with the Evil Conſequences of the ſame; upon which are made ſome practical Inferences. Thirdly, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Covenant of grace in the Second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> wherein I have touched on all the Duties incumbent on Believers under that Covenant, and have met with all the emergent Caſes of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, incident to Believers, in the militant State, ſuch as ſpiritual deſertion, Afflictions by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Impriſonment, Poverty, Reproach, loſs of, and being forſaken by Friends and Relations, and have collected and applyed the ſeveral promiſes to the reſpective caſes, and in the cloſe, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the Duty of Chriſtian Patience, and Perſeverance, with the promiſes ſuitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and laſtly, have drawn a large Series of Chriſtian Duties, and Truths, in ſhort Heads, with the Scriptural Proofs thereof; ſo as in two or three Pages, the marrow of the whole is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; and as I dare averr in all Chriſtian Sincerity, theſe Sheets were only Collected for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and Domeſtick uſe, without any intention
<pb facs="tcp:65284:13"/> of ſending them to publick view, by which means they are in a more naked and rude dreſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Curioſity of Eloquence or Artificial patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as by the importunity of ſome Friends, I was induced to ſend them abroad, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire thus much in Chriſtian Charity, that thou mayeſt believe that theſe are the effects of ſerious enquiry into the Holy Scriptures, with Meditation and Prayer, and narrowly ſearching into Truth, with what ſtrength I could obtain by grace; and that neither in Oſtentation, or for ſecular ends they are ſent abroad, but in all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, if it may be, that others may find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that Light and Eſtabliſhment in the way of God, which I hope I have, and ſhall find, and conceiving this to be a Duty, according to that of the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Look not every Man on his own things, but every Man alſo on the things of another,</hi> Phil. <hi>2.4. and that thou mayeſt have the Truths of grace Sealed on thy Soul, and that Chriſt may dwell in thy Heart by Faith, and that being Rooted and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love, thou canſt be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> Eph. <hi>3.17, 18, 19. and that thou mayſt be filled with all the fulneſs of God;</hi> In all ſincerity is the earneſt Prayer of, thine in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65284:14"/>
            <p>Firſt, If we conſider <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt and root of all Mankind, that he was of God created after the Likeneſs of God, in his Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28. and at his firſt Creation had power and command given him to increaſe and multiply, and ſubdue and have dominion, over the Fiſh of the Sea, the Fowls of the Air, and every thing that moveth on the Earth, (under reſtriction from eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil) with a penalty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eating thereof, that he ſhould ſurely dye. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. Thus Man made after the Likeneſs of God, and in the Image of God, let us examine what this Likeneſs and Image was; The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that it was <hi>Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24.</p>
            <p>The ſame Apoſtle elſewhere informs us, that it was <hi>in Knowledge, after the Image of him that Created him,</hi> Col. 3.10.</p>
            <p>By theſe words of Righteouſneſs, true Holineſs, and Knowledge, we may underſtand, that <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Creation, was endowed with all ſuitable faculties of the Mind, to underſtand the Nature of all Beaſts, Fowls, Fiſhes, creeping Things, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatives, how to uſe and apply them to his own uſe, and govern them in order to their ſubjection to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and congruity among themſelves; as we find by Gods bringing the Creatures to <hi>Adam,</hi> to veſt him with Soveraignty over them, and that he might expreſs his faculty of underſtanding, by giving to them names, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19, 20. and as ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts obſerve, he gave to them names ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant or expreſſive of their nature, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Knowledge of their ſeveral Natures, from that primitive Knowledge given to him in his firſt Creation.</p>
            <p>By Righteouſneſs rendred in the Latine Juſtice,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65284:14"/> as it is the Likeneſs, and Image of God, we muſt underſtand all integrity of Mind, leading to what is right, and forbearing what is wrong.</p>
            <p>By true Holineſs, we muſt underſtand, all purity of Mind, Will and Affections in Sincerity and Truth, to affect only and deſire what is juſt, pure, holy, and good, and to ſhun all Thoughts, Affections, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Purpoſes to the contrary, as <hi>God is of purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by that Knowledge of God, according to the Image of him that created him, we muſt underſtand effectual and ſufficient knowledge, not only of things natural, but alſo of Spiritual Truths, by which man was made effectually capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to do good, to abſtain from, and reſiſt evil.</p>
            <p>Thus Man being compoſed, in ſuch excellent frame, capable to underſtand all things, as well of God himſelf, as of the Creatures, and that he had his Being of God, and ſufficiently underſtood the Terms under which he was confined to his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Obedience to God, and the conſequence of his Diſobedience, and there being given to him entire Integrity, not tainted by any pollution, or diſabled by infirmities, in full poſſeſſion of all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enjoyments, with the knowledge of the glorious ſoveraignty of God, and Majeſty in the Creation, ſufficient to delight himſelf in God, and glorifie his Maker in the Station he had placed him. If <hi>David</hi> after the Apoſtacy, when for Sin the World was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and brought under the Curſe and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, did then admire Mans Excellency, Power, and Glory, how much more when in Mans Integrity, unity of the Creation, without Enmity, Jarring, or Diſcord, Emulation or Contention? the Morning Stars ſang together, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy. How had the firſt Man rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65284:15"/> to cry out; <hi>How excellent art thou Lord in all the Earth? And what is Man; that thou remembreſt him, or the Son of Man, that thou art mindful of him?</hi> And what reaſon had he? And how much had it been his and the happineſs of all Poſterities, to have ſate down contentedly, in admiration and obedience of God, and in quiet poſſeſſion of all created enjoyments, and ſubjection of the Creatures to him?</p>
            <p>Thus Man Created in Righteouſneſs, true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Knowledge, after the Image of God, made Lord of all the Creatures, and in poſſeſſion thereof, having ſufficient knowledge to underſtand his Duty and Intereſt, and to know the advantage of Obedience, and conſequence of breach of Duty, breaks the Chain of his Obedience; and eats the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p>Whereupon God in his Juſtice, according to his Promiſe, and Terms of Mans firſt Creation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives Man of his Soveraignty over the Creatures, puts Enmity between Man and the Creatures, and accurſeth Man, and the Earth for his ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.14. to the end.</p>
            <p>This being the Matter of fact in Mans Creation, under the Penal Law, and his Breach, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, and the puniſhment of his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we come next to examine the nature of this firſt and original ſin, and conſider whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted only in this ſingle Act, of eating of the Tree of Knowledge; or what other ſins were, or are complicated in it.</p>
            <p>If we conſider Man as truly endowed by God, with Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, and under the Prohibition of a Penal Law, we ſhall find all the ſins committed and diſcovered in after Ages, under the growth of Corruption, to have been in that tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That wilful breach of Gods Law and Sin,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65284:15"/> cannot be palliate, under the excuſe of the ſin of Ignorance, for that mans knowledge was ſtrong and ſufficiently clear, to underſtand good and evil, and in reſpect there was a poſitive prohibition againſt ſuch offence, it muſt imply knowledge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore makes it a wilful breach and offence againſt a known Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It cannot be called the Sin of Infirmity or ſurprize, as <hi>Adam</hi> would have excuſed himſelf, by the Womans giving of the fruit to him, and the Womans Apology of the Serpents beguiling her; for that they were foretold, that they ſhould not Eat of that Fruit, and forbid the eating thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalty of Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12, 13. and that the knowledge they had of good and evil, and that to break the Commandment of God was evil it ſelf, although it had not been under the Penalty expreſſed, and therefore having in themſelves ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to underſtand, and ſtrength to defeat and reſiſt the force and arguments of Satans Inſinuations, this Sin was a vehement and bold preſumption againſt the Juſtice and Authority of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Sin was of the greateſt Pride and Ambition imaginable, for that God had endowed Man with knowledge ſufficient in every reſpect, to make him happy, in underſtanding all things to complete his ſatisfaction and delight in God, and the Creatures; nevertheleſs upon Satans Inſinuation, that, by eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they ſhould become more knowing and be like Gods, knowing Good and Evil, they wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Pride and Ambition of their Hearts, luſted after knowledge to be equal with God, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience broke Gods Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This Sin was of greateſt unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Gods Truth and Juſtice, in believing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Lye, <hi>(you ſhall not ſurely die,)</hi> Gen. 3.4. and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65284:16"/> Gods word, <hi>thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Whereby to their own ruin, and ruin of their, Poſterity they yeilded to a deceitfully, and did not obey the Truth and righteouſneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, This eating of the Tree of Knowledge, implyed the greateſt Murmuring, Repining, and Ingratitude, for that God had given to Man, the Uſe of and Dominion over all the Creatures and had only reſerved one ſingle Tree, with a Prohibition from meddling with it; nevertheleſs man is not Content, but muſt have all, not remembring, or willfully forgetting, that he had his beginning and being of God, and what he had, was of and from him, and that he had what was ſufficient to make him happy; yet was his Covetouſneſs without bounds.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This Sin was of the greateſt Sloth, imprudence, and inadvertence, in that while God had endowed Man with Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, when Satan did accoſt him, with a Ly, to break the Command, he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the Righteouſneſs and Hoilneſs of God, that it was impoſſible for God to Lie, and thereby ſhould have reſiſted Satans Suggeſtions, founded on a Ly from the Holyneſs and Goodneſs of God in giving man all things; he ſhould have reaſoned that it was not juſt in him to murmur at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in mans being reſtrained from ſome thing, and upon Satans firſt Suggeſtion of a Ly againſt God, he ſhould not have liſtned further to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Credit of Gods truth and continued in his Obedience.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, From the Method of Committing this Sin, all manner of Sin ſeems to be employed in it the Text ſaith, <hi>And when the Woman ſaw that the Tree was good for Food, and that it was pleaſant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be deſired to make one
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65284:16"/> wiſe: She took of the Fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo to her Husband with her, and he did eat,</hi> Gen. 3.6.</p>
            <p>From hence we ſee when Satan by a lying Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion had tampered with the Woman, ay and got her to liſten to his temptation, from her ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of (being as Gods) ſhe lets her thoughts out to a further ſurvey of the apparent excellencies and advantages to be had in the eating of that fruit, and thus ambition kindleth luſt, and one luſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth another, ſo the heart ſwelling with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of further Knowledge, and that ambition runs to the Eyes, and from the Eyes to the Senſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and thus the whole Maſs is tainted and defiled, and let out to the gluttinous poyſoning of the Soul to the Rebellion of Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be that ſame thing which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.</hi> Which is an entire Maſs of all pollution, ſo that it was not only the eating of that fruit which was the Sin only, but the Infection that was got into the Heart and Affections, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the goodly frame of Righteouſneſs, Holyneſs, and true Knowledge became all tainted and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the deceitful Appetites and Luſts of the Fleſh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>By</hi> diſtruſting of God, and then by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous luſting after what was ſet apart from them by Gods prohibition, and ſo breaking the limits of Obedience, lets the Luſt ſwing after a carnal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion or forwardneſs to ſatiate their deſires, and thus diſorders the righteous frame of Juſtice, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Knowledge, lately erected by God in them, ſo that this Sin was not only that actual and only act of eating the fruit, but the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole faculties run into diſorder from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65284:17"/> God, expreſſed by that rebellious act of eating the forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>This alſo ſeems to be proved and explained in many places of Scripture, eſpecially thoſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I had not known Sin, but by the Law: I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid thou ſhalt not Covet;</hi> Rom. 7.7. Where by the word Luſt rendred moſt properly in the Original (Concupiſcence) and the word Covet there, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.17. is properly meant a deſire of what is more than our own, and allowable in Juſtice, and in that place, <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 57.17. Where by Covetouſneſs is meant the luſtful Inclinations, and by the Apoſtle in that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. By luſts he means not ſo much the polluted actions of the Fleſh as the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted fountain of them, <hi>Non pravas Cupiditates ſed illarum fontem;</hi> and the Soul is well called <hi>Sedes Nativae illius labis,</hi> the ſeat of that Natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this ſeems likewiſe to be confirmed by that Scripture and <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was greater in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was evil and only evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> Gen 6.5. Where God chargeth mans heart with this Sin as being the Fountain of the Corruption.</p>
            <p>That of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. Seems to be to the ſame purpoſe, for none were openly ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Atheiſts as to deny the being of God, but the Prophanity of their Converſation leads the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt to charge them with denying of God, whereby he chargeth the heart with the pollution and brings the act of Sin as Inſtance and proof of it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf alſo in that Scripture <hi>But thoſe things which come out of the mouth, come from the heart,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65284:17"/> and they do defile a man,</hi> Math. 15.18, 19, 20. Seems to confirm this Doctrine that Sin principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſteth not in the outward acts, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Corruption and Diſorder of the affections and mind, for here in this Scripture he brings the words and actions of a man to charge the guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart.</p>
            <p>This is explained alſo by the Cuſtom and Laws of Countries againſt Treaſon, where Imagining and Conſpiring to kill the King is made Treaſon and any act which diſcovers or proves that Intention is made Treaſon, but the main guilt lieth in the malice and rebellious Inclinations of the heart in Conſpiring the Kings, Death, and the act is but a proof of it; ſo upon the whole matter we find this great tranſgreſſion of Original Sin was the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate and diſorderly frame of the Spirit of man, let out in diſobedience againſt God, and having once liſtned to temptation, the whole faculties were defiled and did not ſtop until man run into actual rebellion againſt God; So that we muſt look on Man's corrupt Nature as having in it the Complication of all Luſts and Sins, as the Principal cauſe of Gods Wrath and Curſe, and that the act of Diſobedience ſerved for Gods Evidence to prove the guilt of the heart, and this Corrupt Fountain of Nature with the Curſe for Rebellion have our firſt Parents ſent down to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee man lately Righteous, Holy, Pure, and Undefiled, full of Knowledge, Power, Soveraignty over the Creatures, giving Law to them, and receiving Obedience from them; liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Honour, Glory, Pomp, Plenty, and at Pleaſure, having all the Creatures in Subjection to him, and none in Competition with him, a Friend of, and at Peace with God; the Darling of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65284:18"/> Creation; having Glory without Envy, Plenty without Toil, Pleaſure without Trouble; Strength without Infirmities, or Pain; Degraded from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, Clouded with Darkneſs, Peſtred with Contention, Oppreſſed with Toil, Pinched with Difficulties, Obnoxious to Deſtruction from ſuch who lately were under Subjection to him, an Outlaw to God and Baniſhed from his Preſence, his Body a Maſs of Infirmities, and Soul a Cage of unclean Luſts, <hi>The whole Head is Sick, the whole Heart faint, from the Sole of the Foot even unto the Head, there is no ſoundneſs in it, but Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores,</hi> Iſa. 1.5. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our Righteouſneſs are as filthy Rags, and we do all fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like the wind have taken us away, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 64.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy name that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee, for thou haſt hid thy ſelf from us, and haſt conſumed us becauſe of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities,</hi> Iſa 64.7.</p>
            <p>Thus having viewed mans eſtate in his Creation and Integrity, and conſidered his fall and ſteps thereof, we come next to examine how far his Poſterity is concerned in his guilt, and puniſhment thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> being freely Created of God, and by him endowed with excellent Knowledge, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Holyneſs, and made Lord over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Covenant of Obedience, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of Diſobedience, we muſt look on him in the Purpoſe of God, as repreſenting all mankind; ſo as on his performance with God, he ſhould continue and hold all the Priviledges he was dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with, and ſend them down to his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if he ſhould fail, in the Conditions aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he was to forfeit all theſe Priviledges
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65284:18"/> as well for himſelf as Poſterity: this is but what was juſt with God, who freely made Man what he was, and might duely claim the diſpoſal of his own gift upon his own terms; this was only advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to Man having ſo fair a bargain <hi>gratis</hi> without price or any purchaſe, except that of due Obedience, which he was capable to perform, had he not wilfully corrupted himſelf.</p>
            <p>This is illuſtrated by the cuſtomary practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, for when any man lets Land to Leaſe for term of years, reſerving a Rent payable at a certain time: if the Rent be not pay'd at the term aſſigned, the property reverts and veſts in the Leaſſer, and the Tennant is deveſted of his term, and of all benefit thereby; but if the Leaſſee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, he holds for himſelf and aſſigns: This alſo is clear in that caſe, when a King or Overlord makes a Grant for Service to a Man, and his Heirs, if the Grantee performs, he holds for himſelf, and ſends the right and benefit of the Grant to his Heirs; but if he fail the Grant is Extinct by his Non-performance; and the Heirs take nothing by ſucceſſion to him, for that his right in his own time was voided, ſo could not he ſend it down to his Heirs,</p>
            <p>In the Caſe of Treaſon, the Anceſtors blood is corrupted and he ſo dead in Law, that the claim of Succeſſion is cut off, ſo as the Iſſue of his Body can make no claim through him; and not only ſo, but the Anceſtors blood is ſo attainted by Act in Law, that the Poſterity is not only barred from ſucceſſion to what the Anceſtor held, but the Crime of Rebellion or Treaſon is imputed to the Succeſſors or Poſterity, that in all time coming, their Succeſſion is cut off, unleſs by Act in Law, the blood be reſtored; although the Poſterity ſhould not be guilty of the Act of Rebellion, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65284:19"/> Treaſon, on which the forefeit was declared or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewed: In this caſe two fatal Conſequences have hapned to the Poſterity of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, By his Act of Diſobedience he hath ſo far corrupted Nature, ſo as thereby the Nature of all Men by Natural Generation is Corrupted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by breaking of the Command, he in his own life time was diſpoſſeſſed, of the Rich Priviledges veſted in him, and thereby his Poſterity were cut off from the claim of right thereunto,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Adam</hi> by his tranſgreſſion hath corrupted his Nature, and thereby all men by Natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are corrupted, and as partakers of that degenerated Nature, they are guilty of and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion and have lodged in them inherent Corruption.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Adam</hi> by the many enormous ſteps of his Diſobedience above mentioned, hath not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Wrath of God, but alſo Corrupted his Nature; doth thereby appear, by what has been already ſaid, in the Concomitants or ſpecial ſteps of that Diſobedience; for it was ſimply impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſo many irregularities could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in any one Act, as have appeared in this; if the whole Nature had not been polluted, the very Act in the Circumſtances of it clearly prove it, for that ſo many different Concomitants would have jarred and marred that Act, if the chief propenſion of the Affections and Natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had not joyned, whereby we muſt agree, that the whole Maſs was Corrupted and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to rebellion againſt God.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> by his Apoſtacy from God did defile his Nature from the firſt purity, and that all men ſince are the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> we muſt infer that all men by Natural Generation are of a Corrupted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65284:19"/> race and naturally defiled, and conſequently origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal guilt imputable to them, in ſo much as they are part of that Maſs which was corrupted: common experience in all Ages tell us, that unhappy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Parents, either natural, or accidental, render Poſterity exceeding corrupt as well in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals as in bodily habits, and what reaſon can be given, why men beget men, and not beaſts, and beaſts beget beaſts, and not men, but becauſe of the Affinity of Nature, between the Sire and what is begotten? the ſame Parity of reaſon will infer, that from corrupt Men, corrupt Iſſue muſt be produced, and how can it be otherwiſe ſuppoſed? for what is begotten of man, can give no quality to it ſelf, and therefore muſt participate of the nature, and aſcribe its quality to that by which it is begotten.</p>
            <p>This alſo is clear from Scripture, <hi>who can bring a clean thing from an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4.</p>
            <p>If a man be ſinful, polluted and unclean, as <hi>Adam</hi> was after his fall, how could his Poſterity be clean, they have it not of themſelves, and could not claim or derive it from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> gives us for this a clear Scripture proof, in his own acknowledgment of Original guilt <hi>behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</hi> Pſal. 51.5.</p>
            <p>From whence comes this pollution of <hi>David,</hi> the Embrio took it not from its lodging in the Womb, there being nothing there to defile it, therefore it muſt needs have it from its polluted Parents.</p>
            <p>Do not dayly and woful experience inſtruct us, that the firſt Acts of Children is wickedneſs, and if not reſtrained, and inſtructed, they will periſh in Sin and Atheiſm? whence comes this? Man was created Righteous and Holy, untill he wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed himſelf, doth not then this wickedneſs ariſe from that firſt pollution of Nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65284:20"/> deſcended and fell on all Poſterity, and continues ſucceſſively until Nature be poliſhed by Grace, and man be renewed in Chriſt Jeſus, and made conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Image of him that Created him, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true holineſs? wherefore we muſt conclude all men under Sin by natural Generation, and for this the Scripture is moſt clear, <hi>for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin,</hi> and in that other place of the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Wherefore as by one Man, ſin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 3.9. Again, <hi>therefore as by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. For as by one Mans Diſobedience, many were made Sinners, ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be made Righteous.</hi> Rom. 5.12, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Having diſcovered from Scripture, and by other arguments, that by <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion, his Nature was corrupted, and that thereby his Poſterity, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his corrupted complexion and nature, are alſo tainted with his corruption, and are thereby guilty of his original Tranſgreſſion, we come next to conſider the conſequences thereof upon his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and theſe are twofold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> are made ſubject to Death, and diſabled from ſucceeding him in the many priviledges he enjoyed in his Integrity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are diſabled in natural enjoyment and ſpiritual performances.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, as we have already cleared, upon <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion an act of attender paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and he was deprived of his Soveraignty over the Creatures, enmity was ſowed between him and them, and the Earth was accurſed for his ſake, and he himſelf expoſed to toil, miſery, and ſorrow, ſo that all theſe evil effects have fallen on his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and they alſo made ſubject to Death. This is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65284:20"/> already cleared from their participation of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and conſequently, the Judgments which have followed muſt alſo affect them, and they are thereby brought under the Judgment of Death, as by that Scripture already cited, <hi>as by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, ſo Death paſſed upon all men, for that all men have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12. So as <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſeen Death if he had not ſinned; and ſinning was brought under the Judgment of Death, all his Poſterity likewiſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him, are liable to the Judgment of Death, <hi>For the Wages of ſin is Death,</hi> Rom. 6.23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are not only diſabled, from ſucceeding him in that glorious ſtate of his Integrity, but are diſabled in the uſe of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enjoyment, and ſpiritual performances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In natural and temporary enjoyments, for though the World be reſpited from utter ruine, and God continues Man on Earth with a Courſe of Day and Night, and the uſual ſeaſons, nevertheleſs ſince the Curſe on the Creatures for Mans Sin, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Creature delights is attended with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, that Mans Life is a continual dying, and a Life of Sorrow, <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is of few days, and full of trouble, he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down, he flieth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not.</hi> Job 14.1, 2.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Davids</hi> teſtimony of the greateſt of Men, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Men of low degree are vanity, and Men of high degree a lye, to be laid in the hallance, they are altogether lighter than vanity,</hi> Pſal. 62.9. If we take <hi>Solomons</hi> opinion of the whole World, he plainly tells us, <hi>all is Vanity and Vexation of Spirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. all. The holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives us an Inventory of the World, <hi>In the World is only the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life; and theſe things are not of God and periſh in the uſing.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16. The holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65284:21"/> Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, that <hi>the whole Creation is brought under ſubjection, and groans under bondage for Sin.</hi> Rom. 8.20, 21. So that ſince the Curſe for Sin, the World is but a Stage of Sin, Sorrow, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>This alſo is proved from daily experience, what Age, Nation, City, or Family is exempted from the laſh of mortality, miſery or changes? is not the greateſt Earthly glory, honour, wealth and ſtrength, clouded in a moment and brought to nothing? and this is the juſt effect of mans Sin and Rebellion, and will be the continuing Lot of the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Reſtoration of Man in Chriſt Jeſus, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Image of him that created him, and that the bondage of the Creation be reſtored by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and reſtitution of all things by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21, 22.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing wherein Man is diſabled by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Sin, and inherent Corruption from the firſt pollution, is not only natural feebleneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all the vital and corporal faculties being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, from that original, wholeſome, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſtitution of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby the actions are either corrupt or faint, in compariſon with what they were before the Fall; but alſo in Religious performances and duties, ſo as all theſe actions, and performances, are either wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſinful, or ſo weak, and ſcanty, that they are rather a Skeleton or Picture, than real Duties.</p>
            <p>This is illuſtrated from theſe three Inſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the corruption of the Fountain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From daily experience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the corruption of the Fountain of our actions, or performance of Duties; It being already proved, that Man, having wilfully polluted and diſordered the frame of Holineſs, Integrity,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65284:21"/> and Knowledge, in which he was created, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the Heart and Affections, from whence acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and performances do flow, how can pure and full performances or duties be expected from thence? Man being in his Heart and Thoughts pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, his Actions muſt be ſuitable; <hi>to the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled is nothing pure, but even their Mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi> Tit. 1.15. This is of neceſſary conſequence, <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt conclude, that ſo long as the Fountain of the Heart is defiled, ſo muſt the actions and performances coming from thence be impure and weak, and until <hi>Man be renewed in the Spirit of his Mind,</hi> by regeneration in Jeſus Chriſt, he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains corrupt and polluted until he be again reveſted with that holy Spirit and that a new heart be given to him, by which again he may be enabled to walk in the Statutes of God to do them, by vertue of that promiſe, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Scripture is moſt clear, that all the Actions of a Carnal Man (ſuch as are all the Iſſue of <hi>Adam</hi> until reſtored by Regeneration) are ſinful, and unacceptable with God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His Thoughts are polluted and defiled, <hi>and God ſaw that the wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart, was only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His words are defiled and ſinful, <hi>but unto the wicked God ſaith, what haſt thou to do to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my Statutes, and take my Covenant in thy Mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt Inſtruction, and caſteth my Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee?</hi> Pſal. 50.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Actions are all evil, <hi>the Ploughing of the Wicked is ſin,</hi> Prov. 21.4.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65284:22"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The very Religious Actions or Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Duties of the Wicked are ſinful. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. <hi>He that turneth away his Ear from hearing the Law, even his Prayer ſhall be an abomination,</hi> Prov. 28.9. <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you, yea when ye make many Prayers, I will not hear, your hands are full of blood,</hi> Iſa. 1.11 <hi>to</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>This point we may thus conclude, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flows from a Carnal Man, whoſe Mind and Heart is defiled, muſt be impure and unacceptable to God, for that <hi>the Carnal Mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Wherefore until the Fountain be purified, and the imbred prejudice of the Heart be taken away, and man be reconciled to God in Chriſt Jeſus, nothing coming from him can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Experience clearly proves, ſuch diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in every performance, Religion for moſt part is wrapt up, in a bare exerciſe of outward actions of Devotion; Formality, Ceremony, and cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry performances, are come in ſuch repute that men eaſily deceive themſelves and ſit down at eaſe in theſe performances, without ſearching into the frame of the Spirit towards God, or examining the ſpring and motive of theſe Duties, or ſcope and end of their Devotion, not regarding whether theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be undertaken and performed, in obedience of the Command, in Faith, in Senſe of Sin, in Eye to the Glory of God, or remorſe for Sin, in ſenſe of ſelf pollution, and in a deſire of renovation and aſſiſtance to perform, and in every thing to deny our ſelves, and depend on God by Faith; but lull their Conſciences for moſt part ſecure, by having done
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65284:22"/> what was cuſtomarily reputed religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <p>Let a Man pretending to religion more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, examine himſelf impartially, he ſhall find ſuch diſorder of Thoughts in religious duties, ſuch narrow and ſcanty apprehenſions of God, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of his Thoughts and Affections, diverting him from the right, and leading him to improper objects, unruly interruptions, ſuch ſcanty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and ſuch uneaſineſs under theſe duties, that Cuſtom rather than Conſcience (and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for Self) if not carnal Intereſt at beſt, than for Gods Glory and Salvation, is the chief Impulſe or Spring of ſuch actions. But as to the arraigning of the Affection before God, whether placed on God, or Luſts; Faith on Chriſt for Juſtification, and Salvation, the work of Mortification, unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repentance, Chriſtian Patience, Charity, Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love, and new Obedience, are Riddles, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hid from Carnal apprehenſions, and made mens duties, but rather thought nuſancies, ſcare crows, and enmity to the World and the fleſh; ſo that we muſt conclude, that in nature we are without ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, for any Righteous performances, and that until the Law of the Members be brought under the Law of the Spirit, we can do no good thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>For I know that in me, that is in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing, for to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>For I ſee a Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my Members.</hi> Chap. 7.23. Here we have a clear deſcription and proof of mans natural Incapacity for doing any good, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity we muſt aſcribe to the corruption of the Heart &amp; Affections, which had its riſe from ſin in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having cleared what Original Sin in <hi>Adam</hi> was,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65284:23"/> and how his Poſterity was tainted therewith, and made liable to the fatal Conſequences thereof, we come in the third place to make ſome practical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from thence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If from the premiſes it be an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able truth, that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Perfection, and Integrity, and that he fell under the moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Apoſtacy, and that in his Tranſgreſſion were complicated all manner of Sins, that Nature was polluted in him, that all after Poſterity are tainted with his guilt, and made liable to the conſequences of his Sin. How little reaſon have the greateſt and richeſt Men of the World, to boaſt, and how great reaſon have they to humble themſelves, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of their Pedigree?</p>
            <p>For that their deſcent was from him, who once was the moſt glorious, abſolute, richeſt, and only Soveraign on Earth, who for his Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Ingratitude, and Murmuring, was forfeit, degraded, made miſerable, and debaſed, That they are at beſt, of corrupted, adulterate and degenerate blood, and extraction, Scripture doth clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, <hi>Cauſe</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to know her abominations, thy Birth and thy Nativity is of the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>thy Father was an Amorite, thy Mother a Hittite,</hi> Ezek. 16, 23.</p>
            <p>This People was lineally of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but had followed the Idolatry, and wickedneſs of the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and Hittites, therefore are they ſaid to be of that Pedigree; we ſee Chriſt would not ſuffer the Scribes and Phariſees amongſt the Jews, to claim to <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe they did not his works, we ſee the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chargeth the Jews to be an adulterous race, and that they were of a Mother divorced from her Husband, <hi>where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorcement, whom I have put away? behold for your Iniquities, have you ſold your ſelves, and for your tranſgreſſions is your Mother put away,</hi> Iſa. 51.1.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65284:23"/>
            <p>What glory is it to be of noble blood, which for the worſt of Crimes was attainted, and to be of Illuſtrious birth, when the Iſſue is Adulterous and Spurious? this is the Fountain and Spring of the Blood and Pedigree of all Mankind, of higher or lower degree on Earth, and this croſs bar is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Scutcheon of all Mortals, this is that <hi>Mené Tekél,</hi> Dan. 5.25. the Motto of all the natural Iſſue of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this ſtain is not to be blotted out, but by the Blood of that Scape Goat, the Lamb, Jeſus Chriſt, who muſt blot out <hi>the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that was againſt us, contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Sin having ſuch Complication of all manner of ſin in it, and being the Fountain from whence came all manner of Corruption, look not on it as one ſingle act, to be extenuate with that excuſe of eating only a little of forbidden Fruit, but look on it, as a poyſoned Fountain, in which were lodged all enchantments to ſin, and that deliberate contraction of enmity againſt God, <hi>an evil Heart of unbelief,</hi> ſtuffed with malice, glutted with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſwellen with pride, cankred with envy, fretted with diſcontent, and boundleſs in deſire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When by Providence Affliction or Chaſtiſement for ſin cometh, conſider, that before Sin came, there was no ſorrow, that Juſtice and Judgment muſt attend Iniquity, and as Sin was firſt puniſhed by a deluge of miſery on Mankind, ſo the Continuance muſt not eſcape the like fate; and look on all acts as coming from that Fountain of Corruption, and make not the ſingle act of any one tranſgreſſion, the ſole cauſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repentance, and reformation, but run the act to the ſpring of the Heart, and fix on the Soul that vehement deſire, fear, zeal, indignation and revenge in the act, and corruption in the fountain, <hi>what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65284:24"/> Indignation, yea what fear, what vehement deſire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge!</hi> and never meet with any ſin or temptation to it, but with an Eye of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie as over a Pit of Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When Providence deprives thee of any Earthly enjoyment, for the reaſons in Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, murmur not to be denied ſome of thy deſires, but remember thou waſt guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> of grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God the reſerving of the Tree of Knowledge, and by thy impatient bearing of loſſes thou makeſt the old ſore of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion bleed afreſh in diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but rather let the memory of Original Sin, oblige thee, to ſubmiſſion, contentment, ſorrow and repentance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Are all men guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are of the ſame corrupted and degenerate blood, and ſome by courſe of Providence raiſed to Wealth and Honour above others, what reaſon then hath the exalted, or brother of high degree, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him on whom the deceitful Riches of this World, have not ſmiled? this Man who diſpiſeth his Brother, is forgetful of himſelf, as if not of the ſame blood with the other, <hi>he is like a man beholding his natural Face in a glaſs, he beholdeth himſelf, and goeth away, and forgetteth what manner of Man he was,</hi> Jam. 1.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The Riches, and Honour of this Life, ſhould not raiſe a Man in eſteem of himſelf above his brother, for what he hath is given to him of God, who can as equally level him with his Brother, and thereby make him remember his own Pride, and that the other is of the ſame Blood with him. See the Inſtance of this in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and many others. <hi>I</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, <hi>praiſe and extol, and honour the King of Heaven, all whoſe Works are Truth, and his ways Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thoſe that walk in Pride he is able to abaſe.</hi> Dan. 4.29. to the end.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65284:24"/>
            <p>Conſider what the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith of Carnal partiality, of preferring the Rich in Gay Clothing, with a goodly Gold Ring, and deſpiſing the poor Brother, and what arguments he uſeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and are become Judges of evil thoughts? hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he hath promiſed to thoſe that love him, and ye have diſpiſed the Poor? do not Rich Men oppreſs you, and draw you before the Judgment Seats, do not they blaſpheme that worthy name by which ye are called? if ye fulfil that royal Law, according to the Scripture, (thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf) ye do well, but if you have reſpect to perſons ye ſin,</hi> Jam. 2. to 10.</p>
            <p>Here by ſtrong arguments he proves the partial preferring the Rich before the poor to be ſinful.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that the Godly though poor in this World, is the worthier perſon in Gods eſteem, in that he is choſen of God, an heir of the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Great and Rich Men, are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Godly, they bring them before Judgment Seats, and oppreſs them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Rich Men are not Enemies only to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men, but to God, and Blaſpheme his Holy Name.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the royal Law of God commands the Duty of equal love, love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſince Pride, and Ambition, was a cheif ingredient of that firſt Fountain of ſin, let none through Pride, diſpiſe him who was of the ſame blood with himſelf, though not in that equal Worldly Splendor or Glory, but conſider, as Pride did ruine <hi>Adam,</hi> and abaſed all his Poſterity, ſo Juſtice will take the like vengeance upon all the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> guilty of the ſame Crime. <hi>Whoſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65284:25"/> diſpiſeth the poor reproacheth his Maker,</hi> Prov. 17.15. <hi>God is Maker of poor and rich,</hi> Prov. 22.2.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Are all men of one Blood and Family, and ſo Brethren and <hi>Members one of another?</hi> Eph. 4.24. This calls all men to mutual Sympathy, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aſſiſtance and ſupply of one another, this is that expreſs Command of Chriſt, <hi>that ye love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as I have loved you,</hi> John 13.34. And the Apoſtle preſſeth this moſt vehemently; <hi>Whoſoever doeth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> 1 John 3.10. <hi>We have paſſed from Death to Life if we love the Brethren, and he that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death; he that hateth his Brother is a murderer and hath not Eternal Life: We ought to Lay down our Life for the Brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>This Love conſiſts not only in the Airy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of profeſſed and pretended Friendſhip, but</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a general Sympathy, Fellow-feeling, and Compaſſion, in all Conditions, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances Spiritual and Temporal, like Chriſts Love to his Church: <hi>In all their Afflictions he was Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them; in his Love, and in his Pity, he redeemed them, and carryed them all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Love is extenſive to all wants and neceſſities or elſe it is empty and profiteth not: <hi>Whoſo hath this Worlds good, and ſeeth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of Compaſſion, how doth the Love of God dwell in him?</hi> 1 Joh. 3.17. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is to the like purpoſe, <hi>If a Brother or a Siſter be naked, and deſtitute of Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food; and one of you ſay to them, depart in peace, he ye warmed and filled, notwithſtanding ye give them not theſe things which are needful to the Body, what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 15.16.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65284:25"/>
            <p>Seventhly, Is it ſo then of a lamentable truth, that all men are concluded in <hi>Adams</hi> Apoſtacy, and that there is a woful Degeneracy in the Soul of Man, from that primitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and <hi>that all men in Nature are dead in Sin, and have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the Luſts of the Fleſh, fulfilling the deſires thereof, and of the mind, according to the Courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the Power of the Air; the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Diſobedience, and are by Nature the Children of Wrath.</hi> Eph. 2.1, 2, 3. And that there is even amongſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>a Law in the Members warring againſt the Law in the Mind,</hi> Rom. 7.23. Ch. 8.1. And that by reaſon of Sin, <hi>the Creature is Subject to Vanity, and the whole Creation groaneth and travelleth in pain for the Adoption and Redemption.</hi> Rom. 8.20, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>And that in this degeneracy, a mans life is his burden, and there is no true pleaſure under the Sun, confirmed in Solomons experience, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hated life, becauſe the work that is wrought under the Sun is grievous unto me; for all is vanity, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Spirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.17. all.</p>
            <p>Seeing then this Earth is but a ſojourning, and no abiding place, and that here is neither Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Reſt, nor Happineſs; how much is it mortal mans concern, anxiouſly, reſtleſly, and with a believing Impatience to purſue cloſe after theſe two things?</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That as by one man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, ſo Death paſſed upon all men, for that all men have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.12.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65284:26"/> for the coming of the Bridegroom, who cometh as a Thief in the night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. And may earnestly pray that the Bridegroom would haſten the coming of his Kingdom, and the new Heavens and the new Earth, and ſet the Sons of God at liberty from the Liberty of Sin and Corruption; and that the glad Tydings of that Heavenly Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may be heard: <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with Men, and God ſhall dwell with them, and they ſhall be his People, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their Eyes: and there ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more Pain: For the former things are paſſed away,</hi> Rev. 21. <hi>to</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed <hi>Adam</hi> in his Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, in Glory, Honour, Righteouſneſs, true Holineſs, and perfect Knowledge, with abſolute Soveraignty over the Creatures, the Darling and Friend of God, and all the Creation at Unity and Peace with him and in Subjection to him, and in Amity amongſt themſelves: And afterwards by Man's falling from God, Man the declared Enemy of God, and by a guard of Angels barred out of Paradiſe, deprived of his Soveraignty, and Enmity ſowed between the Creatures, and the Earth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and the Creation brought under Bondage, and the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> (once the apparent Heir of all Righteouſneſs, true Holineſs, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Honour, Glory, and Soveraignty over the Creatures) diſabled and cut off from that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſucceſſion, and expoſed unto all miſery and under the ſervitude of Sin and Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And in place of that Unity of the Sons of God, and ſhouting together for joy; nothing to be ſeen or heard, but Subjects rebelling againſt their Soveraign, and the whole Creation Split in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65284:27"/> Enmity, and Envy, Malice, Oppreſſion, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, to have filled the whole Earth; where is that corner of the World, where ambition for Dominion, Covetouſneſs for Wealth, private or publick animoſities, have not drowned the ſenſe of all comfortable enjoyments? Man raging againſt the Creatures, and they againſt him, and each in contention, devouring one another, and nothing to be ſeen, but a woful Convulſion, and diſmal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and the degenerate frame of that firſt and beautiful Fabrick of the Creation, from its ſo late purity and glory.</p>
            <p>This then being the Tragical Condition of all Mortals Subject to Sin and Miſery, as entailed on them from the Inherent Corruption of Nature, <hi>Job</hi> 5.6. Who can with-hold the Churches lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of Sion, with a Cloud in his anger, and caſt down from Heaven to Earth, the beauty of Iſrael, and remembred not his foot-ſtool, in the day of his anger, what thing ſhall I take witneſs for thee, what ſhall I liken unto thee O Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>what ſhall I equal unto thee, that I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee, O Virgin Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>for thy breach is great like the Sea, who can heal it?</hi> Lam. 2.1, to the end. <hi>How is the Gold become dim, how is the moſt fine Gold changed? the Stones of the Sanctuary are poured out in every Street, the pretious Sons of</hi> Zion <hi>comparable to fine Gold, how are they eſteemed as Earthern Pitchers, the work of the hands of the Potter?</hi> Lam. 4.1, 2, all. <hi>And with the Holy King and Pſalmiſt heavily lament, wo is me that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>and dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 120.5.</p>
            <p>This being the univerſal ſtate of Miſery to all Mankind as in the place before cited, Man is born unto troubles as the ſparks fly upward. It being no more natural, to the Sparks to come out of fire and fly up, then to man born in Sin, to meet with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65284:27"/> ſorrow and miſery, and therefore all Men ſhould Copy out the Prophets methods and wiſh, Oh that my head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep, day and night, for the ſlain of my People, <hi>Oh that I had in the Wilderneſs a lodging place, of way faring Men, that I might leave my People and go from them, for they be all Adulterers, an aſſembly of treacherous Men, and they bend their Tongues like their bows for lies, but they are not valiant for the Truth upon Earth; for they proceed from Evil to Evil, and know not me, ſaith the Lord, take ye heed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to his Neighbour, and truſt ye not in any brother, for every Brother will utterly ſupplant, and every Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will walk with Slanders, they weary themſelves to commit Iniquity, thine habitation is in the midſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, through deceit they refuſe to know me ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.1, to 7. <hi>And ſhould alſo with the Church, ariſe, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the Watches, pour out thy Heart like Water before the Face of the Lord, lift up thy Hands towards him, for the Life of thy young Children, that faint for hunger in the top of every Street,</hi> Lam. 2.19. And with the ſame Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, Rachel</hi> weeping for her Children, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be comforted becauſe they were not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.25.</p>
            <p>Now if the holy Prophet was thus in an Agony of grief, for the Sin and Miſery of one Nation, and People, and the Church for her private ſtate, and the holy King for his uneaſineſs under ſuch Companions; how much more reaſon hath every Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> not, only to mourn for, and bewail his private guilt, and miſery, but alſo to lye low in ſelf abaſement, humiliation, repentance, and bitter Complaints of the univerſal miſery of all mankind as Sons of Wrath by Nature becauſe of Sin?</p>
            <p>This being the diſmal Eſtate and Condition of Man by Nature, in which is too great matter of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65284:28"/> mourning, and lamentation, methinks I hear the loud ſounding of bitter groaning, under the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bondage of the Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22. And a voice grievouſly putting the queſtion, Is the plant of renown of Gods Creation utterly cut off? <hi>Hath the Lord forgot to be gracious, will he be favourable no more, are his tender Mercies clean gone for ever?</hi> Pſal. 77.7, 8, 9. Pſal. 85.5. Pſal. 89.46. In anſwer to which I was led to that place, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine Eyes from tears, for thy works ſhall be rewarded, and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy, and there is hope in thine end, and thy Children ſhall come again to their own Land,</hi> Jer. 31.16, 17. And while in deep contemplation of this conſolatory voice, and plunged with reflections on Mans Incapacity, to reconcile himſelf to God; and of the apparent impoſſibility, I was led to that of the Prerogative of God, <hi>With Man this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible,</hi> Mat. 19.26.</p>
            <p>And to that pretious Truth, <hi>My Thoughts are not your Thoughts, nor my Ways your Ways, ſaith the Lord, for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my Thoughts higher than your Thoughts, and my Ways than your Ways,</hi> Iſa. 55.8, 9.</p>
            <p>And being further plunged in the deep contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mans Rebellion, and of the Juſtice of God, which requires Attonement for Sin, and finding Man had nothing wherewith to come before the Lord, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of an Omnipotent, Holy and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Majeſty, I was loſt between the belief of his Faithfulneſs who had promiſed, and the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent impoſſibility; I was carried to that Scripture, <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and Grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. And to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundations of the World, that we ſhould be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65284:28"/> holy and without blame before him in love,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before the World began,</hi> Tit. 1.2. And to that other clear truth, <hi>for as much as ye know, that ye are not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, but with the pretious blood of Chriſt, as a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot; who verily was fore-ordained before the Foundations of the World, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times in you,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And being alſo carried to view that Scripture, <hi>And I will put enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed, and her Seed; It ſhall bruiſe thy Head and thou ſhalt bruiſe his Heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. by all which, I was brought to underſtand that the ſame Eternal Wiſdom and Council of God, whereby at firſt Man was created in the Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. by which the Fall of Man was foreſeen, the Reſtoration of Man to the ſame Image of God was alſo decreed, from all Eternity by Gods Eternal goodneſs and free bounty, and by means above the reach of Man to contrive, or his power to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, <hi>viz.</hi> by Jeſus Chriſts taking upon him the Humane Nature, and ſhedding his blood to death, to expiate the guilt of Mans Sin, as in that of the forecited teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being the unfolding of that great miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mans Redemption, and Eternal Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, as by Gods Grace ſhall be more fully explained in the enſuing Diſcourſe; If the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the miſerable Eſtate of Man in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Deſcription, juſtly occaſioned and called for, from all men, deep humiliation; ſorrow and repentance, how great Reaſon have all Men, with all adoration, humility, and thankfulneſs, to cry out with the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Oh the depth of the Riches, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out, for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65284:29"/> who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Rom. 11.33, 34. And with the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>That ye being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth, and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth Knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulneſs of God,</hi> Eph. 3.17, 18, 19. And to admire Infinite Goodneſs with the Holy Prophet, <hi>For ſince the beginning of the World, Man hath not heard, nor perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye ſeen, O God beſides thee, what he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. And further of the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this love, read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed the firſt eſtate of Man in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and his eſtate of Apoſtacy from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of the miſtery of Gods Love, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good Will to Man, in Chriſt Jeſus, we come next to conſider, how in infinite Wiſdom the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man is contrived.</p>
            <p>We have already diſcovered how God of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made man in a happy and glorious eſtate after his own Image, and upon the Condition and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of obedience, he was made Lord of all the ſublunary Creatures, and that God putting Mans Stock in his own hand, and though he was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enabled to perform Obedience, nevertheleſs through the Concupiſence of his Heart he broke his Allegiance to God, and incurred to himſelf and poſterity the forfeiture of all the glorious Dignities and Priviledges given to him, and he and his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were concluded under Miſery and Wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Sin, ſo that having no capacity in himſelf to be reconciled to God, and retrieve his loſs, the Infinite Wiſdom and Bounty of God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as above is diſcovered, did determine mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration to a better and ſurer Eſtate and Condition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65284:29"/> than what he was in at his firſt Creation, and that ſame Infinite Wiſdom foreſeeing that Man having corrupted his Way and Heart, the Fountain of Actions, <hi>And that the Thoughts and Imaginations of his Heart were evil and only evil continually,</hi> Gen 6.5. <hi>And that his Heart was deceitful and deſperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17.9. And though he intended Mans Reſtoration and Eternal Happineſs, yet becauſe of the pravity of Mans Heart, he was neither to be treated with upon his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, nor fit to be truſted with a new Stock in his own ſtrength, and therefore Heavenly Wiſdom, appoints the only begotten Son of God, and Second Perſon of the Holy Trinity to be a Mediator for Man, and by him enters into an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Man, which ſhall be demonſtrated in the enſuing Diſcourſe, and that as well to ſatisfie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice for Mans Tranſgreſſion, as to ſecure to Man the future Stock of Gods bounty, granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by vertue of this New and Second Covenant, and what this Covenant is and the terms of it ſhall be the next Subject of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This Covenant commonly called the Covenant of Grace: is mutual between God and Man through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, who in Scripture is called the Mediator of the New Covenant: conſidering this Covenant, we ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, Take notice of the freedom thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of the terms of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to the freedom, It being apparent that God of his Free-Will and Goodneſs, without any tye, neceſſity, or obligation upon him, for his own Glory, Created the World and Man, in that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtately Condition as we have heard, and that Man by his Rebellion departing from God, had incurred the execution of Juſtice upon himſelf, and all after Poſterity, and that the Pravity of Mans Nature was ſuch, that it grieved and repented
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65284:30"/> God that he had made Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. There lay no obligation upon God to reſtore loſt Man, but that God intending to make Bounty and Mercy, as it were, to triumph over Juſtice, and magnifie his Infinite goodneſs; by the Council of Heaven, this myſtery of Chriſts love is contrived, by which Juſtice is ſatisfied, and Man is not only relieved from the ſervitude of Sin, and delivered from wrath to come, and inſured in a better eſtate than what he was in at firſt, but alſo is made Heir to all the moſt excellent priviledges contained in this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which ſhall be branched forch in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The frequent teſtimonies of the Spirit in the New Teſtament, witneſs the freedom of this Covenant. <hi>Having Predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf according to the good pleaſure of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.5. <hi>But God who is rich in Mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath he quickened us together in Chriſt; by Grace ye are ſaved,</hi> Eph. 2.4, 5, 11. <hi>And not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us, abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, that being Juſtified by his Grace, we ſhould be made Heirs according to the hope of Eternal Life,</hi> Titus 3.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God, being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth, to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins, that are paſt, through the forbearance of God, to declare his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he may be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.21, to the end. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength in due time Chriſt died for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65284:30"/> ungodly, God commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us, for if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life,</hi> Rom 5.6, to 11. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. and other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable places of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 15, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. to 15, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.17, to 33. <hi>James</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>By all which we ſee the bleſſing of this Covenant coming freely of Grace, by the Council of Heaven, Chriſt undertaking for impotent, helpleſs ſinners, and enemies, and this undertaking approved and accepted of, by the forbearance of God and the ſuffering of Chriſt, coming as a propitiation and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to Juſtice for Mans offences, who was in no capacity to help himſelf, the freedom and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this love of Chriſt in this new Covenant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, yet more particularly in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As man was of himſelf incapable to make ſatisfaction to Juſtice, and reconcile himſelf to God, ſo he was not fit to be treated with by God in his own perſon, becauſe he had altogether defiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was of no Integrity, therefore Jeſus Chriſt becomes Mans Surety to God, to perform for him the Conditions on Mans part, which he doth by offering himſelf up to Juſtice for Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. And by his Spirit of Grace enabling Man to do ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual homage and obedience to God, <hi>and by ſo much was Jeſus made the Surety of a better Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 2.22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth not onely become Mans Surety, but actually clears and diſcharges them from the debt of Sin to Juſtice, and frees Sinners from the penalty of eternal wrath for Sin, <hi>for he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65284:31"/>
            <p>Herein doth the Suretyſhip of Chriſt for Man differ from the ſuretyſhip amongſt Men, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, when one becometh Surety for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he contracts for relief from him whoſe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he is, and only lends his Credit for a time, but will not pay the debt for him, if he can by Law avoid it, and if he be conſtrained to pay it, he will force relief from the other if he be able, and if not able, will treat him with all ſeverity for his own relief; but Chriſt Jeſus neither expects or deſires any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction or relief, but freely of his own good Will pays the Debt and expects no return but the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and thankful acknowledgment and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mercy of forgiveneſs and priviledges obtained by him to the debtor.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He becomes a Curſe for ſinners, and frees them from the Curſe due for their ſins, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law being made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>For it is Written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree,</hi> Deut. 21.23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He doth not only free us from the Curſe for Sin, and Puniſhment of Juſtice, but alſo frees them from all Imputation of guilt for Sin, and obtains the condemnatory Sentence of Juſtice, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, to be cancelled and nailed to his Croſs of Satisfaction to Juſtice, that the ſame ſhall never retort upon them to their prejudice, <hi>And you being dead in your Sins, and the Uncircumciſion of the Fleſh, hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven you all Treſpaſſes, blotting out the Hand-writing of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way nailing it to his Croſs,</hi> Coloſſians 2.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Herein alſo is a ſecond difference between Chriſts love to me, above that amongſt men, for when a ſurety is obliged to pay the Debt of another, he taketh Aſſigments to the Creditors Debt, and keeps
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65284:31"/> it on foot againſt his Friend, either to force ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from him, or to keep him in conſtant trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, fear, danger, and diſquiet of mind, but Chriſt doth not only, early, chearfully, and willingly pay the debt, but alſo cancels all the inſtruments of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puts the debt in utter oblivion. <hi>And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members their ſins no more,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. and quiets their Thoughts from the fear of their danger, or after trouble for their Debts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He doth not only ſatisfie Juſtice, take off the Curſe, and procure them Indemnity, but alſo procures the Imputation of Righteouſneſs to them, as he was made ſin for ſinner, though he knew no ſin, ſo he makes them righteous through him, though they were altogether unrighteous in themſelves. <hi>And he received the Sign of Circumciſion, a ſign of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not circumciſed, that the righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo; now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe in him who raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.11, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Herein is manifeſt the excellency of Chriſts love to ſinners above any thing amongſt men, for men commonly upbraid others with their good offices done, and if one man ſuffer the leaſt injury from another, eſpecially in paying a debt for him, the ſame is not only a continual reproach, but prejudice ſo far prevails, that they never afterwards aſſiſt them in any good office, but rather defame and leſſen their reputation, than advance them to any good, though it may be in their power; but Chriſt glorieth in the good Office done, and is ſo far from upbraiding his poor friends, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. That he will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65284:32"/> not only have all names of reproach (from their former tranſgreſſions) taken off, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.4. but he will have them farther advanced, and though they were in themſelves unrighteous, he will have his own righteouſneſs imputed to them, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and is ſo tender of their reputation, that he will have all their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities covered and waſhed away in his own blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.23, 24. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World, according to the Will of God and our Father,</hi> Gal. 1.4.</p>
            <p>We do not read in Scripture that Chriſt upbraids any Repenting Sinner with their Sins committed before their Converſion, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> after her Converſion was not reproached with uncleanneſs, <hi>Peter</hi> with denial of Chriſt, nor <hi>Paul</hi> for his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perſecuting of him. This of upbraiding or reproaching the Penitent with their former tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions is clear contrary to the Method God takes with his People, for in that famous Scripture, <hi>Eze.</hi> 33, The Spirit of God tells us the Righteouſneſs of the Sinner ſhall not juſtify him without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new Obedience, <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the Righteous he ſhall ſurely live, if he truſt to his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and commit Iniquity, all his Righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred, but for his Iniquity that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited he ſhall dye for it,</hi> verſe 13. And on the other hand the Sins of the Penitent ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred againſt them. <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again that which he hath robbed, and walk in the Statutes of Life, without committing Iniquity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye, none of his Sins that he hath committed ſhall be mentioned unto him, he hath done that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live,</hi> ver. 15, 16.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65284:32"/>
            <p>The Lord is a Spirit of meekneſs, tender hearted and compaſſionate, and he knoweth that the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate are a people afflicted and broken in Heart for their Sins, and under a continual ſenſe of being under a body of death, and that they often want the <hi>Oil of Joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. To ſupport them under their fainting fits, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> therefore in his gracious condeſcenſion he miniſters conſolation to his People. <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones, for I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth for the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made,</hi> Iſa. 57.15, 16.</p>
            <p>From whence we may have theſe two Leſſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A Leſſon of Caution, Humiliation, and Watchfulneſs to the Godly and Penitent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, An advice againſt cenſoriouſneſs and raſh judging of others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As to Godly and Penitent, haſt thou upon ſerious enquiry into thine own Heart, Affections, and Converſation, found that Godly ſorrow and repentance for ſin ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11. And explained in this enſuing Diſcourſe, <hi>Page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And haſt found Faith warranting thee to believe that Chriſt Jeſus who knew no ſin, is made ſin for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And thou made the Righteouſneſs of God in him, and that the Hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Gods Juſtice as to thee, is by him blotted out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14. Then conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, What thou art called unto, <hi>That as ye have learned Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> Hath he made thee Righteouſneſs who was dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, not by thine own work of Righteouſneſs, but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65284:33"/> of his Grace, and by his Power of Regeneration, art thou juſtified) not by the Law of thy Works, but by Grace and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Romans</hi> 3.27, 28.</p>
            <p>T,hy works are only Obedience, Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which are given to thee by him, and though they neither have juſtified nor can juſtify thee, they are thy duties, and what thou canſt do is but duty, and thou ſhouldſt account thy ſelf an unprofitable Servant as to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. And though in the acceptance of God through Jeſus Chriſt, thou art accounted Righteous, thou muſt continue in holy duties, in all manner of converſation, and muſt not continue in Sin, that Grace may abound, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ſin and crucified in Chriſt, thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt walk in newneſs of life to the deſtruction of the body of Death, that we may live with Chriſt, <hi>Let not therefore Sin reign in your Mortal bodies, that you ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof, neither yield ye your Members as Inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs to Sin, but yield unto God as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your Members as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs unto God; and ſin not, becauſe thou art not under the Law but under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6. to 16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Art thou in thy apprehenſions renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, and haſt a loathing ſenſe of Corruptions, is the Bond-woman of Sin and Satan, caſt out by the power of Regeneration and Grace, leave not thy houſe empty, but get it freſhly ſtockt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Grace, conſider what Chriſt ſaith of the Man out of which the Devil was caſt out, that if he find the Houſe empty, <hi>he will return with ſeven Devils worſe than himſelf, and the laſt ſtate of that man will be worſe than the firſt,</hi> Luk. 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Be inſtant therefore in Prayer to God for increaſe of Grace, and Guard againſt old favourite Luſts and Corruptions, that they return not again to entangle
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65284:33"/> thee to Folly, take the Apoſtles advice, <hi>be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary the Devil as a roaring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour, whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 8.9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Art thou Righteous to God by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, not by thine own works and power, be humble in the ſenſe of thy own incapacity and inſufficiency for any good in thy ſelf, and ſay with that holy Apoſtle. <hi>For I know that in me, that is in my Fleſh there dwelleth no good thing, for to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good that I know not, for the good that I would I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do: for I find a Law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me. O wretched man that I am! Who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this death?</hi> Rom. 7.18, to 25. And be deeply ſenſible of the weakneſs and imperfection of all thy Graces and Attainments, as rotten Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and menſtruous Clouts, as in and from thee, and that in thy ſelf there is no ſoundneſs, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs from the ſole of the Foot to the top of the head, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ch.</hi> 64.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to cenſoriouſneſs and raſh judging the Scripture tells us, that <hi>offences muſt come, but wo to them by whom they come,</hi> Luke 17.1. And as none are more obnoxious to be ſlandered, reviled and evil reported of, and be treated cenſoriouſly, and uncharitably than the Godly, this they may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for their Comfort and Patience, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple muſt not expect better entertainment than his Maſter, nor the Servant than his Lord, and as Chriſt was reviled with being a friend to Publicans and Sinners, a Wine-bibber and a Drunkard, and that he did caſt out Devils by <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.32, 33, 34. So may the Children of God contentedly ſit down under the uncharitable conſtructions of the Enemies of Truth, after the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65284:34"/> example of Chriſt, <hi>who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>As the Children of God when they do well and ſuffer for it, are called to ſuffer patiently as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts example in the foregoing Scripture, ſo the uncharitable and cenſorious <hi>Rabſecahs</hi> whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to ridicule the Truth of God, diſparage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and load the zealous for God, with reproach and infamy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.8, to 14. ſhould do well to remember that uncharitable cenſoriouſneſs is a great ſin againſt God, and to take on them to charge the Profeſſors of Religion with Hypocriſy, is aſſuming to themſelves the Prerogative of God, of knowing mens Hearts, which alone is the peculiar power of God, Jer. 11.20. ch. 17.9, 10. Pſal. 7.9. 1 Sam. 16.7. <hi>Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Man can charge another with any Sin, but if he ſearch into his own Heart and Ways, he may find himſelf guilty of that ſame or worſe Sins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he chargeth his Brother, wherefore he ſhould take Chriſts directions, firſt <hi>To take the beame out of his own Eye, before he challenge the Mote in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eye, and not to Judge leaſt he be Judged,</hi> Mat. 7. to 6.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch conſider how much a narrow uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cenſorious Spirit, is contrary to that love, tenderneſs and charity, which is commanded and recommended in Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. all, and that if any brother or profeſſor of truth be fallen under any ſin that he be reclaimed in the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not treated with bitter invectives and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. and that ſelf-humiliation is the beſt means of anothers conviction, and the true Chriſtian duty, <hi>For whoſo exalteth himſelf ſhall be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luk. 14.11.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65284:34"/>
            <p>Let ſuch conſider how injurious ſlander and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is to the reputation of a Chriſtian, and how ill it is reſented by the Spirit of God in Scripture, for the Lord accounts his People ſo nearly related to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he will not have them injured, ſo that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the Injury done to them to be done to himſelf. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Eye,</hi> Zach. 2. and 8. There is that ſpeaketh like the piercing of a Sword, but the Tongues of <hi>the Wiſe is Health;</hi> Prov. 12.18. And though Malice and Prejudice may raiſe a ſlanderous report, nevertheleſs, neither in mans eſteem at long run, nor in Gods account ſhall it have any weight, but ſhall be wiped off in courſe of time, although the Innocent and Godly may ſuffer for a time, <hi>Lips of Truth</hi> ſhall be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever, but a Lying <hi>Tongue is but for a moment,</hi> Prov 12.18, 19.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch farther conſider how deteſtable lying, ſlandering and reproaching is to God. <hi>Lying Lips</hi> are an abomination to the Lord, <hi>but they that deal truely are his delight,</hi> Prov. 12.22. We ſee that the railing Blaſphemous Reproaches of <hi>Rabſecah,</hi> and the great King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> againſt the People of God, is accounted by God againſt himſelf. <hi>Whom haſt thou reproached and blaſphemed, and againſt whom haſt thou exalted thy voice, and lift thine Eyes on high? even againſt the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>By thy Meſſengers thou haſt reproached the Lord, and haſt ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.22, 23. read all, and read, <hi>chap</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch further Conſider What badge, and brand of folly is put upon Peeviſh, Uncharitable, Narrow and Cenſorious Perſons, who either raiſe ſlanders or by reporting foment them, <hi>He that hideth hatred with lying Lips and he that uttereth ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a Fool; in the multitude of words there wanteth not ſin, but he that refraineth his Lips is wiſe: The Lips of the righteous feed many, but Fools die for want
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65284:35"/> of Wiſdom. It is a ſport to a Fool to do miſchief, but a man of underſtanding hath Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 10.18. <hi>to</hi> 24. Prov. 26.21.22. <hi>See the words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the bleſſing of the upright the City is exalted, but it is overthrown by the Mouth of the wicked: He that is void of Wiſdom deſpiſeth his Neighbour, but a Man of underſtanding holdeth his peace, a Tail-bearer revealeth Secrets, but he that is of a faithful Spirit concealeth a Matter</hi> Prov. 11.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Let all ſuch remember that ſuch reproaching ſlandering and defaming do more miſchief to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the long-run than to the Godly, for that the Godly ſhall be juſtified by their Integrity both before God and Man, and the malice of the wicked ſhall be retorted upon themſelves <hi>The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the upright ſhall direct this way, but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall fall by his own wickedneſs; an Hypocrite with his mouth deſtroyeth his Neighbour, but through know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall the juſt be delivered; the righteous is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his ſtead,</hi> Prov. 11.5. <hi>to</hi> 10. <hi>His own Iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf and he ſhall be holden with the Cords of his ſin,</hi> Prov. 5.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch perſons alſo conſider the Character given in Scripture to the Malicious and Slanderers. <hi>His mouth is full of curſing and deceit and fraud, under his tongue is miſchief and vanity; he ſitteth in the lurking places of the Village, and in the ſecret places doth he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Innocent; his eyes are privily ſet againſt the poor, he lyeth in wait ſecretly as a Lyon,</hi> Pſal. 10 7. <hi>to</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>By which may be gathered that ſuch are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted treacherous and murderers in Scripture language.</p>
            <p>But let us on the other hand obſerve and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the event of all the prepenſite malice of the wicked againſt the godly, and we ſhall find it ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65284:35"/> up to their own ruine, <hi>He hath prepared againſt him Inſtruments of Death, he Ordaineth his Arrows againſt the Perſecutors. Behold, he travelleth with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, and hath conceived miſchief, and brought forth falſhood. He made a Pit and Digged it, and is fallen into the Ditch which he made. His miſchief ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon his own head, and his violent dealing upon his own pate,</hi> Pſal. 7.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>The Lord ſhall cut off all Lying Lips, and the Tongue that ſpeaketh proud things,</hi> Pſal. 12.3.</p>
            <p>Let us obſerve what the Pſalmiſt foretells ſhall be the end of ſlanderers and ſlandering Tongues, <hi>Thy Tongue deviſeth miſchief: Like a ſharp Raſor, working deceitfully. Thou loveſt evil more than good: And lying rather than to ſpeak righteouſneſs. Thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all devouring words, O thou deceitful Tongue. God ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever, he ſhall take thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living.</hi> Pſal. 52.2. <hi>to</hi> 6. Let us view the revilings and reproaches of God-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and his People by the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and his Meſſengers in that 2 Kings 18. And the Judgments of God both on Meſſengers and their Maſter in that 2 <hi>Kings</hi> Chap. 19,</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God is ſo compaſſionate even to the offenders amongſt his People, that though he will not have ſin and offencies amongſt them go without chaſtizement, yet will he have Mercy and and Charity to be ſo mixed with Juſtice that his People may not be reduced to deſpair in reference to Gods purpoſe toward them, as in that famous place of his own Juſtice and Clemency; <hi>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: Leſt the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Soul which I have made. For the Iniquities of his Covetouſneſs was I wroth. I have ſeen his ways and will heal him:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65284:36"/> I will lead him alſo, and reſtore comfort unto him and to his mourners,</hi> Iſa. 57.15. <hi>to</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>In which we ſee Mercy ſo mixed with Juſtice, Clemency, and Bounty, that Correction and Chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizement is only intended of God for the good and reclaiming of his People, and not for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. We find alſo by Gods direction in the puniſhment of offences by Judges amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the very number of ſtripes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted were appointed, and not to be exceeded, <hi>Forty ſtripes</hi> he may give him, and not exceed, leaſt if he ſhould exceed and beat him above theſe, with many ſtripes, then thy Brother <hi>ſhould</hi> ſeem vile <hi>unto thee,</hi> Deut. 25.3. Whereby it is clear that the Lord will not have the very Sinners amongſt his People to be made contemptible by the inflicting of Juſtice upon them, but will have the Rod only uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the ſtubborn; and their name and reputation, nevertheleſs, to be kept up; ſo as they neither deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair in themſelves, or ſhould be reproached by others if they could be reclaimed, Prejudice and Paſſion will expoſe to contempt, which is expreſly cautioned againſt, and implied in theſe words, <hi>then thy Brother ſhould ſeem vile unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This calls on all profeſſing Religion for the Spirit of meekneſs, compaſſion, charity, and tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, even to ſuch as are either under the Rod of affliction, or taken under any infirmity to ſin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on their Repentance, and to check that heat of uncharitable judging, or reviling which is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſſed in Scripture eſpecially by the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Throughout the whole chapter, where he exhorteth to unity, peace, and love, in particular inſtances, and expreſſeth the ſame by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments. <hi>Firſt, They are all</hi> of one body, and one ſpirit one <hi>hope of</hi> our Faith, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. Secondly, <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> ver. 5. Thirdly,

               <hi>One God and Father of all</hi> by which they are Brethren, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Fourthly, They have all ſeveral gifts, and all uſeful, and therefore none either to be deſpiſed or envied, all being given for edifying of the body, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, to 16. Fifthly, They are all joined and compact together, in the unity of the Spirit, as the Joints and Sinews unite the Body, they are Members all of the ſame body, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Sixthly, <hi>They are all Members one of another,</hi> ver. 25. And therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with the Command of theſe Heavenly Duties <hi>be ye angry and ſin not,</hi> let not the Sun go down on your wrath, neither <hi>give place</hi> to the Devil. <hi>Let all</hi> bitterneſs, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be put from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for <hi>Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> ver. 26, to end. And the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere, let us <hi>not Judge</hi> one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling <hi>block before his Brother,</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>Put on therefore as the</hi> Elect of God, holy and beloved bowels of Mercies, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forbearing one another, forgiving one another, and above all theſe things, <hi>put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> Col. 3.12, 13, 14. See how zealous this holy Apoſtle is to unite the People of God in Love, throughout his whole writings. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain glory, but in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind let each eſteem others better than themſelves, look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others,</hi> Phil. 2. to 9.</p>
            <p>The whole Scriptures run in this ſtrain, <hi>above all things</hi> have fervent Charity amongſt your ſelves, for Charity ſhall <hi>cover the multitude of ſins,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.8. and add to Godlineſs brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs, <hi>Charity,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.7. And above all this we have the expreſs command of our great
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65284:37"/> Lord and Lawgiver Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>be ye</hi> therefore merciful as your heavenly Father <hi>is merciful,</hi> Luk. 6.36. a new commandment I give you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that ye alſo love one <hi>another,</hi> John 13.34.</p>
            <p>To conclude this diſcourſe, it were deſireable, that all of the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, though of different methods and worſhip, would ſeriouſly conſider how much it is the incumbent duty of all Chriſtians, to ſtudy the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace, how agreeable it is to the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, from his own Mouth, as alſo by his Meſſengers as well in the old Teſtament as under the new. <hi>Have we not all one Father, hath not one God created us, why do we deal treacherouſly every Man againſt his Brother,</hi> Mal. 2.10. How much it would remove the ſtumbling of Heathens, Idolaters, Atheiſts, and the Prophane, who are much ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by the Diviſions of Chriſtians, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the reformed Churches, how much it would ſtrengthen their hands againſt the Enemies of Truth, and what great inducement it might be, to invite the diſſolute, and prophane, to join in a body or Church incorporated by love, and ſerving of God with one conſent, what eaſe, ſatisfaction, comfort, and delight, it would create to each other, when differences, janglings, and contention about leſſer things, were removed, and the ſubſtantial part of Religion, to wit holineſs towards God, Charity and Brotherly kindneſs with one another, were more ſincerely purſued? How much it would adorn the pretious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch unity would be like that pretious Ointment on the Head, which run down to the Skirts of the Garment, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 133. and would give a moſt pleaſant ſavour to all the beholders, and to Chriſtians themſelves, like the Churches Spikenard, Myrrhe and Camphire, <hi>Cant.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65284:37"/> 1.12, 13, 14. and being once experimentally found, will conſtrain them to ſit down under the ſhadow of God, who is Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and Wiſdom, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.1. with great delight, and would undoubtedly find <hi>his fruit pleaſant to their taſte,</hi> Cant. 2.13. This alſo would be a ſpecial mean to entangle others into the Net of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>From all which we plainly ſee the unexpreſſible freedom of this Grace, and love of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which as firſt founded in Free-grace, is alſo accompliſhed unto us by the myſtery of his love, and to enquire into the Tenure and Condition of this Covenant cometh next in courſe.</p>
            <p>This Covenant of Grace, Mercy, and Salvation, is between God and Man, by the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt; and the Conditions thereof are mutual on Gods part, and Mans part.</p>
            <p>The Juſtice of God being offended by Mans falling in diſobedience, and the Counſel of Heaven deſigning Mans Reſtoration, by means above mans apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and capacity, the bounty of Heaven makes a Proclamation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is the great <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Mans Reſtoration and Eternal Happineſs, and as it come of the good Will of God, is free; nevertheleſs, for the honour of Juſtice, and for the further ſecurity of Mans fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, this Covenant is circumſcribed with conditions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, On Gods part a free Pardon, and reward of Eternal life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, On Mans part <hi>believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as we have already ſhewed that Man render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf incapable of doing any good, much leſs to ſatisfy Divine Juſtice, or in his own ſtrength to

            <p>Firſt, A Prophet, the office of a Prophet is to teach, inſtruct, declare, and reveal the mind of God to his People.</p>
            <p>And that Chriſt is that only true Prophet, the whole Scriptures concur in Teſtimony, he is that Prophet foretold, by whom that Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. And that Prophet promiſed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet amongſt their Brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my words into his mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them all that I ſhall command him,</hi> Deut. 18.18. And he is that Prophet of whom the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Of this Mans Seed hath God according to his promiſe raiſed unto</hi> Iſrael <hi>a Saviour Jeſus,</hi> Act. 13.22. And this is that rod out of the Stem of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> on whom the Spirit of the Lord doth reſt, <hi>The Spirit of Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord, he ſhall not judge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſight of his Eyes, nor reprove after the hearing of his Ears; but with Righteouſneſs ſhall he judge the Poor, and Reprove with Equity, for the meek of the Earth, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65284:38"/> ſhall ſmite the Earth with the Rod of his Mouth, and with the breath of his Lips ſhall he ſlay the Wicked, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhall be the Girdle of his Loyns, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Girdle of his Reins,</hi> Iſa. 11. <hi>to</hi> 11. And this is that Prophet who hath received the Spirit in full, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath appointed me to Preach good tidings to the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captive, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, and to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in</hi> Zion, <hi>to give unto them Beauty for Aſhes, the Oil of Joy for Mourning, the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61. to 4. He is the only true Sheepheard of the Sheep, and entreth in at the Door, to whom it is opened, and the Sheep hear his voice and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, he knoweth his Sheep, calleth them by their Names, and leads them into the true and good Paſtures, <hi>John</hi> 10. to 6. He is the infallible guide and teacher, <hi>He is the Way, the Truth, the Light and Life, and no Man cometh unto the Father but by him,</hi> Joh. 14.6. He is the only true light, that lightneth every Man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.6.</p>
            <p>This then being the firſt ſtep of Chriſts Mediation between God and Man, to be their Teacher, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them their duty towards God by his infallible Spirit, this ſhould lead us again with the Apoſtle to cry out, <hi>O the depth, and infinite</hi> dimenſions of the Love and Wiſdom of God to ſinners. If we conſider Mans Fall from his credulity, in believing the lying ſuggeſtions of a fallen Angel in the Mouth of a Serpent, and not believing of God and that to avoid mans ſplitting on this Rock, God ſends his infallible Spirit of Truth, to guide them in all Truth, and bring them under the Law of the Spirit, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65284:39"/> and a new Life in Chriſt Jeſus, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Spirit in them, to make them walk in the Spirit, and no more in the unprofitable courſe of this World, in the Fleſh and Luſts thereof, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth them with the Wiſdom and Graces of his Spirit, to perform to God new obedience, as ſhall be ſhewen in examining of the Chriſtian Duties, as the conditions of this Covenant on Mans part, how much ſhould the conſideration of this myſtery of Love and Wiſdom, lead our anxious deſires after attaining unto a large ſtock of this enriching and confirming Grace, and to be endowed with the knowledge of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus! by which poor Believers are not only retrieved from Sin and Wrath, but are kept ſure in Chriſts Hand from falling away from God, as under the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>John</hi> 17.6, to 13.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of Chriſts Mediatory Office, is to be a Prieſt, and the Office of a Prieſt being to offer up Sacrifice for Sinners, we ſhall conſider how this agreeth to Chriſt, and is performed by him, the holy Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That he that deſireth the Office of a Biſhop or Teacher, deſireth a good work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1. And he alſo tells us that it is ſo honourable and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, <hi>that no man taketh it to himſelf, but he that is called thereunto as was Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5.4.</p>
            <p>And therefore God in diſpleaſure with <hi>Uzziah</hi> the great King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for intruding into the Prieſts Office ſtruck him with Leproſy to his death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18. to end. But none can claim better or ſo good a Title to the Prieſthood, as our great high Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt, who took not that honour to himſelf, but it was given to him of his Father, who ſaid to him, <hi>this day have I begotten thee, and thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>And although he was <hi>Heir of all things, and by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65284:39"/> whom the World was made, and being the brightneſs of the Fathers glory, and expreſs Image of his perſon, he was annointed with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.2, 3, 9. And made the High Prieſt, by the Council of Heaven, for Mans Eternal Salvation, and as he had this his call, immediately from Heaven, ſo he hath it, with more tranſcendent eminency than other Prieſts, in many conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that all Prieſts taken from amongſt Men, are compaſſed about with Infirmities and Sins, and as in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to others, ſo alſo for their own as well as for the ſins of others, they are to offer up Sacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 7.23, 28. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.7. but this our great High Prieſt though in Compaſſion to us, he took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon him, <hi>and was ſubject to natural Infirmities, and in the Fleſh was tempted with like Infirmities, to ſuccour ſuch as were tempted, yet without ſin,</hi> Heb. 2.16, 17, 18. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.15. However he is eſſentially holy, <hi>for ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens, who needeth not daily, as theſe High Prieſts, to offer up Sacrifice, firſt for his own Sins, and then for the People, for this he did, once when he offered up himſelf,</hi> Heb. 7.26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All other Prieſts are made without an Oath, but he with an Oath, <hi>for thoſe Prieſts were made without an Oath, but this with an Oath, by him that ſaid to him, the Lord Swore and will not Repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>and hath an unchangeable Prieſthood,</hi> Hebrews 7.21, 24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Other Prieſts are for a time, his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is for ever, and unchangeable, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Scripture, <hi>They were many Prieſts, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue, becauſe of death, but this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65284:40"/> wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them, for the Law maketh High Prieſts which have Infirmities, but the word of the Oath which was ſince the Law, maketh his Son, who is conſecrated for evermore; for Chriſt is not entered into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the Preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 9.24. Heb. 7.23, 24, 25, 28. And by the Holy Apoſtle <hi>John, If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> 1 John 2.1.</p>
            <p>From theſe Scriptures we have a clear proof of this conſolatory Doctrine, that Chriſts Prieſthood continueth when mens ceaſe, for his is Eternal, theirs are but while they are on Earth; but on the other Hand, Chriſt hath entered into the Heavens to make Interceſſion for us, and although he hath once for all, fulfilled the Sacrifice to Juſtice for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nevertheleſs he is ſtill at a poſt of Interceſſion in Heaven, with the Father, to make our requeſts known, and to procure the anſwer to our Petitions; and as at his leaving of the World, he told his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he was going to the Father, and told them <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son, and if ye ask anything in my name I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14.13, 14.</p>
            <p>It clearly appears his Mediatory Office is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but continueth, and will continue until the reſtitution of all things, and he give up the Kingdom to his Father.</p>
            <p>As this Doctrine affords great conſolation to all Believers, that in all their wants Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, while in their Pilgrim ſtate, they are aſſured of an Advocate to make Interceſſion for them, ſo we have a clear confutation of that errour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſet up the Doctrine of Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65284:40"/> and Interceſſion of Saints, which exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derogates from the Prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt, who is that great High Prieſt and only Mediator for Sinners; for the Apoſtle is moſt poſitively clear, that Prieſts amongſt men are not ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue becauſe of Death, but this man continueth for ever, ſo as nothing can be clearer than that their Office determines with their Lives, and his continueth in Heaven, making Interceſſion for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>What can be a greater contradiction of Scripture, and more derogatory to the ſole Prerogative of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts Mediation, than to allow the power of Interceſſion to any Saint or Angel, whoſe Office is extinguiſhed when they yield up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Prieſts amongſt Men, offer Sacrifices of corruptible things at the charge of others, but this great High Prieſt hath made a Sacrifice of his own blood for the ſins of others. <hi>But Chriſt being come an High Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, neither by the blood of Goates and Calves, but by his own blood, he entred in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us, for if the blood of Bulls, and Goates, and of the Aſhes of an Heifer, ſprinkling the Unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit, offered himſelf, without ſpot to God, purge your Conſciences to ſerve the living God?</hi> Heb. 9.11, 12, 13, 14. and elſewhere, <hi>Looking for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.13, 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil World, according to the Will of God and our Father,</hi> Gal. 1.4. <hi>being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65284:41"/> juſtified freely by his Grace, by the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his righteouſneſs, for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God; to declare at this time his Righteouſneſs that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in Jeſus, where is boaſting then? it is excluded, by what Law? of Works? nay, but by the Law of Faith, therefore we conclude, that a Man is juſtified by Faith, without thee deeds of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.24, to 29.</p>
            <p>Hence then have we this great Doctrine of Chriſts ſatisfaction for Believers, plainly diſcovered and proved unto us, in which we ſee the contrivance of Heaven for Mans Eternal Redemption; <hi>(freely juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied)</hi> that is without merit or reward on our part, but of Bounty and Grace, <hi>(whom God hath ſet forth)</hi> by the joint Council of the Godhead (through Chriſt Jeſus;) here the Sole Mediatory office lodged in him <hi>(through Faith in his blood;)</hi> this is the duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on Believers part <hi>(for remiſſion of Sins that are paſt;)</hi> this is the full ſatisfaction to Juſtice, <hi>(through the forbearance of God)</hi> the conſent of Heaven and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity for Sinners <hi>(that he might be juſt)</hi> that Juſtice might be ſatisfied and ſin expiated by the Blood of Jeſus (and <hi>the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus)</hi> that Chriſts Blood be imputed as ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Sin, without farther ſatisfaction from Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or other Mediators.</p>
            <p>From all which, and almoſt in expreſs words, we have the confutation of that impious Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz. of <hi>Merit, Mediation</hi> of <hi>Saints, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory after Death,</hi> all ſins being done away by the Blood of Jeſus, God being the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus, what room then is there for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory?</p>
            <p>Another difference between our great High Prieſt and Prieſts on Earth is that they offered often, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65284:41"/> he offered up himſelf once for all, a Propitiation for Sin, and thereby at once ſatisfied Juſtice as in the foregoing and other Scriptures, <hi>By the which Will we are ſanctified through the offering of the Body of Jeſus once for all, and every Prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring, and oftentimes offering the ſame ſacrifices, which can never take away Sin, but this Man after he had offered one Sacrifice for ſin, for ever ſate down on the Right Hand of God, for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 9.11, 12. <hi>He entred in once into the holy Place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 10.11, 12, 14.</p>
            <p>From this plain Doctrine of Chriſts once offering himſelf a Sacrifice for Sinners, believers may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves in aſſurance of Salvation from that Sacrifice of his Blood, <hi>and may come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>And may have a ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us, which hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the Vail, whether the forerunner is for us entred, even Jeſus made an High Prieſt for ever, after the order of</hi> Melchiſedeck, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine alſo plainly reproves that Judaick Idolatrous and vain opinion of the Popiſh Maſs, in crucifying a freſh the Lord of Glory, and ſo often as their ſuperſtitious fopperies lead them to it, not remembring, or wilfully not believing, that Chriſt entered once for all within the Vail, and that their ſuperſtitious worſhip, is the old yoak which neither the Jews nor their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>athers could bear, <hi>and was a Figure for the time then preſent, and could not make him that did the Sacrifice perfect, as pertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and onely i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>poſed until the time of Reformation; but Chriſt coming an High Prieſt of good things to come, and by his own blood entered once into the holy place, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65284:42"/> obtained eternal redemption for us, and thereby aboliſhed the ſhadow of Sacrifices,</hi> Heb. 9.9, 10, 11, 12. By his own final Sacrifice, ſo as the Body being come, we ſhould ſtay no more on the ſhadow.</p>
            <p>The third branch of Chriſts Mediatory Office for Believers <hi>is to be their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The honour, wealth, and ſafety of a Nation and People, do commonly depend on the good or bad qualification of their Kings, Rulers, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and we ſee in all Hiſtories that the Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs of a people hath been according to the Vertue, or Genious of their Princes, Rulers, and Governours, and we find in Scripture it is a Curſe to a Nation, when Children are ſet over them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16. and the Church complains as her greateſt afflictions, <hi>Servants have ruled over us, and Princes are hanged up by the hands, the faces of Elders were not honoured,</hi> Lam. 5.8, 12. And that this of having Childiſh Governours, not endowed with ſuitable faculties of governing, is a great Judgment on a Nation, experience tells us, for that thereby all the Fountains of Juſtice are corrupted, and men either do that which is right in their own Eyes, as when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or a King not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or ſufficiently qualified for Government, or the Judges and Inferiour Governours are culled out of Favorites, or men of diſpoſition with the unqualified Governour, and thus as a Judgment for the ſins of King and People, Juſtice which is the only preſervative of the Body Politick is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>The wicked walk on every ſide when the vileſt Men are exalted,</hi> Pſal. 12.6. and according to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Judgment is turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth afar off, for Truth is fallen in the Street, and Equity cannot enter, yea Truth faileth, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from Evil maketh himſelf a Prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.9, to 16.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65284:42"/>
            <p>And as the folly of Princes, corruption of Judges, Interruption, Decay, or wreſting of Juſtice, is one of the greateſt Judgments on a People or Nation, ſo on the other hand, It is one of the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that can attend a People or Nation, when their King, Governours, or Rulers, are of the Wiſe, Juſt, and Prudent; <hi>Bleſſed art thou O, Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles, and thy Princes Eat in due ſeaſon, for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.17. And therefore the Lord promiſeth to his People as a ſpecial token of his love, and <hi>Kings ſhall be your Nurſing Fathers, and their Queens your Nurſing Mothers,</hi> Iſa. 49.23. <hi>I will reſtore your Rulers as at the firſt, and Judges as at the beginning,</hi> Iſa. 1.26. <hi>I will make your Rulers Righteouſneſs, and your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then the glory and ſafety of a People, be in the right frame and Conſtitution of Government, and due qualification of their Governours, how great reaſon then have they to rejoice, who have Chriſt for their King and Governour; As was ſaid of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what Nation or People are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, whoſe God is the Lord, for in him dwelleth all fulneſs of perfection. <hi>He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev. 17.14. <hi>In him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead, he is the only Potentate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.15. In whom is lodged all the treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge, Holineſs, and all Excellency, Iſa. 11. to 6. <hi>He is that wonderful Counſellour, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, of the increaſe of his Government there ſhall be no end,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. In fine in him are treaſured up all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, neceſſary to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65284:43"/>
            <p>The Office of a King chiefly conſiſts in theſe three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To Rule his People by his Laws.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Protect them by his Power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To Reward them by his Bounty.</p>
            <p>The Laws of Kings and Nations eſpecially amongſt the more civilized and Chriſtian, are commonly ſuch, whereby the Prerogative of the King, and the Rights of the People, are reciprocally preſerved and provided for, and under the dominion of Jeſus Chriſt we are not to queſtion, but that all his Laws, which are framed by the Council of Heaven, are all holy, and juſt, and full of ſafe preſervatives, of the ſpotleſs Righteouſneſs of Heavenly Majeſty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per boundaries of Chriſtians duties, as in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19.7, to 12. and are the Laws of the Spirit, and not of the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.1, 2. holy juſt, and agreeable to every exigent of a Chriſtians caſe and condition, and are in themſelves ſo choice and delightful, that the renewed of God delight therein, as ſhall be cleared at length in the enſuing diſcourſe, and this is the conſolation of Believers, that Chriſt as he is the Son, ſo is he the word of God, and in him all the Promiſes of God, are yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of Kingly Power, is, To Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his People, which Chriſt doth, more eminently in many reſpects than any other King.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By defending and preſerving them from falling into evils or dangers. <hi>He ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge over thee to uphold thee in all thy ways, leaſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a Stone,</hi> Pſalm 91.11. <hi>Fear thou not, for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, neither be thou confounded, for thou ſhalt not be put to ſhame, for thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called,</hi> Iſa. 54.4, 5.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65284:43"/>
            <p>Secondly, When they are in trouble he upholds them and keeps them from periſhing under their Burthens. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ſucking Child?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold I have graven thee on the Palms of my hands, thy Walls are continually before me,</hi> Iſa. 49.15. <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Waters, I will be with thee, and through the Rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt through the Fire, thou ſhalt not be burned, neither ſhall the Flame kindle upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 43.2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When they are in troubles, he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them by his Grace, and aſſiſts them with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, until he give them an outgate, <hi>thy Children ſhall make haſte, thy deſtroyers and they that made thee waſte, ſhall go forth of thee, lift up thine Eyes round about and behold, theſe gather themſelves round about and come to thee, as I live ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt ſurely cloth thee with them all, as with an Ornament, and bind them on thee, as a Bride doth, I will contend with them that contend with thee, and I will ſave thy Children, I will feed them that oppreſs thee with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be drunk with their own blood, as with ſweet Wine,</hi> Iſa. 49.17, 18, 25, 26. And in that famous place of the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but what is common to men, but God who is faithful, will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear it.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. And in that other famous place, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy works ſhall be rewarded, and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy, and there is hope in thine end, that thy Children ſhall come again to their own border,</hi> Jer. 31.16, 17. And as he is King ſo is he that merciful High Prieſt, ſubject to the like infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his Brethren, and Sympathiſeth with them, and ſuccors them under their temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.15. <hi>chap.</hi> 5.2. <hi>And is able to ſave them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65284:44"/> to the uttermoſt,</hi> Chap. 7.24, 25, 26. and in fine is univerſally concerned in all their troubles and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, <hi>in all their afflictions, he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bare them all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. And this his power and protection, is not only in general, but in all particular Caſes of Afflictions and Troubles, as ſhall be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed in handling of the Priviledges of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>The third Branch of Princely power over Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is expreſſed in the exerciſe or extent of his bounty towards them, and no King or Prince ever exerciſed ſuch bounty or goodneſs towards his Subjects, as Chriſt hath done, and ſtill doth to all ſuch as believe in him, and that in two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By ſhewing his free pardon of all their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and ſins, by a full and general act of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, entered into the Records of Heaven, by the Blood of Jeſus. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake and will not remember thy ſins,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. <hi>I have blotted out as a thick Cloud thy tranſgreſſions, and as a Cloud thy ſins, return unto me for I have redeemed thee,</hi> Iſa. 44.22. And that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous record of free love, bounty, and abſolution from ſin: <hi>And you being dead in your ſins, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven all treſpaſſes, blotting out the hand writing of Ordinances, that was againſt us and contrary to us, and took it away nailing it to his Croſs,</hi> Col. 2.13, 14. And not only by the pardon of Sin, and thereby delivering from wrath to come, and eternal miſery: But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, By raiſing loſt man from the miſerable ſtate by Nature and Sin, <hi>Ez.</hi> 16. To the higheſt pitch of honour, glory, and eternal happineſs, in making them Heirs of eternal Life, and joynt heirs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65284:44"/> with Chriſt in Glory, <hi>as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13. <hi>and if Children, then Heirs and Joint Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> Joh. 17.22.</p>
            <p>What greater bounty can there be, and what higher love can be expreſſed, or can be equalled to that of Chriſt to Believers. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a Man lay down his life for his friend, but God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> Rom. 5.6. to 11. All which is more particularly inſiſted on in the Doctrine of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thus when we ſee what a happy ſtate is that of a Chriſtian, who can find themſelves within that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and ſure Covenant of Peace, and Eternal Happineſs with Chriſt, who is that infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach his People, and lead them in the way wherein they cannot err, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8. and that merciful High Prieſt, who hath offered himſelf once for all a Sacrifice for Believers, and is able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and is that only Potentate and bountiful Prince, rewards the Faith and Obedience of his People with Eternal glory, from whence may be theſe clear uſes, and inferences of conſolation to all ſuch as believe in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Is Jeſus Chriſt that infallible Prophet, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, <hi>John.</hi> 14.6. to lead and inſtruct his people.</p>
            <p>Is he wiſdom himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. and all things are revealed unto him of the Father? Is the Spirit given to him to bring glad tydings to his People, even to the Priſoners of Hope? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. doth he inſtruct and give Wiſdom, and Knowledge to all that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. Then what perſon can be ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in any of the matters of God, or between God
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65284:45"/> and their own Souls, but here they may have a promiſe of ſupply, he who to Believers is all and in all, is to them in the darkeſt circumſtances their God, and they are commanded to truſt to him, <hi>who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, and walketh in darkneſs and hath no light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. <hi>And he is to them Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is Chriſt that glorious High Prieſt, who once for all, by his own blood hath entered into the holy place, and obtained eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.11, 12. what reaſon is there for diſquietude or doubting, ſeeing he hath ſacrificed himſelf for Believers, even though the black Cloud of their Iniquities be as crimſon and ſcarlet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. and though they may under temptation with <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay, <hi>their way is hid from God, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God,</hi> Iſa. 40.26, 27, 28. to end, <hi>yet in him they ought to comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this, that the everlaſting God, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary, there is no ſearching of his underſtanding, he giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 40.28, 29, 30, 31. And ſhould under the Apoſtles conſideration, <hi>That we have not an High-Prieſt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, without ſin, comply with his exhortation, let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mercy and find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.15, 16.</p>
            <p>And with the ſame Apoſtle, triumph in a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation, to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit, who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65284:45"/> Elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that died yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, making interceſſion for us.</hi> Rom. 8.1, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is Chriſt Jeſus that triumphant, and glorious Champion, <hi>With dyed Garments from</hi> Bozrah, <hi>having trode the Wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath alone, for ſinners,</hi> Iſa. 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Who hath conquered over Hell and Death for ſinners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54, 55, 56, 57. Why ſhould a Believer be afraid and doubtful of his Eternal Salvation in Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering he hath his Promiſe for it who cannot lye. <hi>I even I am he, that comforteth thee, who art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a Man that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man, that ſhall be made as Graſs? and forgetteth the Lord thy Maker, that hath ſtretched forth the Heavens, and haſt feared continually every day, becauſe of the fury of the Oppreſſour, as if he were ready to deſtroy, and where is the fury of the Oppreſſour,</hi> Iſa. 51.12, 13. This one Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Faith in exerciſe, is ſufficient to ſtay the Soul againſt all diſcouragements and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is Chriſt that <hi>brightneſs of the Fathers Glory, and expreſs Image of his Perſon whoſe Throne is for ever,</hi> Heb. 1.3, 8. Hath he dignified man, and abaſed himſelf, in taking Mans Nature upon him, and not the Nature of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. Art thou amongſt men, O Chriſtian contemptible, as a Worm, and no Man: looked upon as the abject and of ſcouring of the Earth as was Chriſt? <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. Why art thou caſt down and diſquieted, is not Chriſt thy Eldeſt Brother, hath he taken thy Nature on him for any other end than for thy comfort? <hi>For that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted he is able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> Heb. 2.18. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy Condition in the World be never ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, lay thou hold on Chriſt as thy Sacrifice, be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65284:46"/> comforted in this, <hi>Though thou haſt lien amongſt the Pots, yet ſhalt thou be like a Dove, whoſe Wings are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Silver, and her Feathers with yellow Gold,</hi> Pſal. 68.13.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is Chriſt thy King, who hath the Keys of Hell and Death, who can bind and no man looſe, and looſe and no man bind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. What Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Confinement, Reſtraint, or Power can keep thee out of his Hands, when his appointed time cometh, <hi>That he will ſend his word and heal and looſe thee?</hi> Pſalm 107.16, 20. Rom. 8.35, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Is Chriſt that bountiful Prince, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gifts to Men, hath he abaſed himſelf to Death to make thee a King, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. art thou in Poverty with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and in thy own ſenſe, and humane appearance thy way is hid from God as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going place, nevertheleſs, remember his power and bounty, <hi>He ſetteth the poor on high, and maketh them families like a Flock, the righteous ſhall ſee it and rejoice,</hi> Pſalm 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7.41, 42. Yea remember his Promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be comforted in it, <hi>I will give thee the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of darkneſs and hidden riches of ſecret places,</hi> Iſa: 45.3. <hi>Prove me now ſaith the Lord, if I will not open thee the Windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it,</hi> Mal. 3.10. But above all whereas the Wicked and Rich of this World, receive their Conſolation in this Life, Wo to you that are Rich for you have received your Conſolation, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24. Believers ſhall be Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, <hi>And they ſhall be mine in that day, when I make up my Jewels, and I will ſpare him as a man ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his own Son that ſerveth him, then ſhall ye return and diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not,</hi> Mal. 3.17, 18.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen in the foregoing diſcourſe, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of man in his firſt Creation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65284:46"/> his unhappy and miſerable eſtate by reaſon of ſin, and alſo, and immediately preceeding this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Lords great clemency and free bounty to Man, by the Counſel of Heaven from all Eternity, in redeeming Man by a Covenant of free Love in Jeſus Chriſt according to that Scripture, <hi>O</hi> Iſrael <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf but in me is thy help,</hi> Hoſea 13. and 9. And as this great Salvation is by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Jeſus Chriſt, wherein he both undertakes for Man, and procures Mercies to Man, ſo there are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incumbent to man on his part of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Although Man by his firſt and original ſin, as hath been already ſhewn, hath diſabled himſelf, that he is capable of no performance in himſelf, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Jeſus Chriſt his ſurety undertakes for him, and he works and accompliſheth all theſe works in him.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conditions on Mans part are variouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture, <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law, tells the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> their duty towards God. <hi>And now O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>what doth the Lord thy God require of thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to ſerve the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his Statutes, which I command thee for thy good,</hi> Deut. 10.22, 23. The holy Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> much to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>he hath ſhewed thee, O Man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God.</hi> Mic. 6.8.</p>
            <p>The duty of Chriſtians under the Goſpel, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Law are morally the ſame, the holy Apoſtle gives us in divers places the account of our duties under the Goſpel. <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the Fleſh, and of the Spirit, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs in the fear of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. And the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere, <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65284:47"/> us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> Titus 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Theſe foregoing and other Scriptures, as well in the old, as new Teſtament, hold out to us, the material and ſubſtantial part of our duties, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the new Covenant on mans part; although grace and ſalvation, comes freely unto us, by the forbearance of God, and free love of Jeſus Chriſt as is already ſhewen, nevertheleſs, it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and juſt, that ſuch precious mercies ſhould be anſwered, with conditions on Mans part, and the rather, for that: Man hath neither ſtrength, power, nor capacity in himſelf to perform. But that as the Covenant is free, ſo grace to perform is freely given and obtained by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. and all the performances of Chriſtians, though never ſo exact, are but the returning to God what we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him and though we may better our ſelves by theſe performances, and thereby render our ſelves more acceptable to God, nevertheleſs we do not at all profit God thereby, for what we can do to God in our Service and Worſhip is but our Duty, and brings him no advantage, according to Chriſts own Doctrine. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all theſe things which are commanded you, ſay, we are uprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which was our duty to do,</hi> Luke 17.10.</p>
            <p>As the holy Scriptures of the old and new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hold out to us the whole complex of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties, which being ſo various, and collected from ſo many ſeveral Scriptures, and for the better attaining to the knowledge thereof, are to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in order, under the ſeveral heads of the duties of the firſt and ſecond Table, ſhall by the bleſſing of God be the ſubject of the enſuing Diſcourſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceed to examine the particular duties
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65284:47"/> of Chriſtians under this new Covenant, we ſhall by the way conſider the great difference between the bounty and goodneſs of God to Repenting Sinners, and the bounty and goodneſs of man to one another, in which we ſhall find made good that Scripture. <hi>As the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my thoughts higher than your thoughts, and my ways higher than your ways,</hi> Iſa. 55.9.</p>
            <p>We have diſcovered that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt his bounty is ſuch, that man by ſin againſt God, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forfeited his firſt and happy eſtate in Paradiſe, and being therefore accurſed and concluded under wrath, is freely reſtored by the Sacrifice of Chriſts Blood, and that all required of him in return of ſuch mercies; is the due obſervance of Gods Commands in new obedience; and that towards mans perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, God in Chriſt Jeſus, makes with him an everlaſting Covenant, that he is their God and they his People, <hi>That he will give them one Heart, and one Way, that they may fear him for ever for the good of them and their Children after them,</hi> Jer. 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>and give them a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 11.19 and <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes and ye ſhall keep my Commandments and do them,</hi> Jer. 36.27. By which we perceive that as the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires duties on mans part, he affords to his people Strength and Grace to perform the duties Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which other Benefactors, neither do, nor can do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord gives power and authority to his people to call on him for a ſupply of ſuch of his Graces, as are neceſſary for them to enable them to walk with him, Ezek. 36.37. <hi>I will yet for this be inquired of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 7.7, 8. and in that famous place, <hi>Ask me of things to come concerning my Sons, and my Daughters, and the works of my hands command ye me,</hi> Iſa. 45.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord doth not only afford ſtock of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65284:48"/> Grace by his Spirit, and gives a command to call for more ſupply, but he alſo rewards the right improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace with freſh Grace, <hi>he will give Grace for Grace, and no good thing will he with-hold from thoſe that fear him. Then ſhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. and this is clear by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Talents, to ſuch as improved, more was given, and Eternal Life as a reward of their well-doing: but he that did not improve, what he had was taken from him, and he himſelf was thruſt into utter darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord delighteth in mercy and not in the ſeverity of his Juſtice, and rather deſires ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould repent and live, than periſh under his Wrath and Juſtice. <hi>Caſt away all your tranſgreſſions, whereby you have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why will you dye O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, wherefore turn your ſelves and live,</hi> Ezek. 18.31, 32. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live, turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye dye O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.</p>
            <p>We ſee in all theſe foregoing ſteps, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and zeal the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath, for the good and converſion of ſinners, and averſation to their diſtruction; but on the other hand, we ſhall find the great prejudice, oppreſſion, and cruelty of men, againſt one another.</p>
            <p>For firſt conſider any man as a benefactor to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in that caſe, where any man hath raiſed ſome to ſome degree of preferment or profit, either of meer good will or favour, and on taking a liking to him as his favourite, or for ſome good office done to him by another, makes him ſome grant to himſelf and his heirs, how frequently doth it happen that either the donor looſeth his fancy or forgets
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65284:48"/> the good office to the donec in his own time? or like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Poſterity of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and thereby reſts not till by ſome means or other, he brings his favourite into diſgrace, and worms from him the grant with Ignominy, and leaves him in worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than he found him, or makes him the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Butt of his diſpleaſure, and expoſeth him to the contempt of others, or if any condition be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable on the grant, makes the Grantee uneaſy, and never at quiet until the grant be voided.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If on the account of Charity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of dealing, one Neighbour or Friend happen on ſome pinching exigent, to ſupply the want of another, how frequently doth Pride upbraid the neceſſitous, and covetouſneſs take theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that what was lent is called and forced back, ſo unſeaſonably and in ſuch rigid and hard terms, that the calling the thing back after ſuch manner, is a greater prejudice, than the ſupply could be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and many are ruined on pretence of friendſhip in lending, when the event is pernicious, and the deſign appears to have been nothing but covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; let ſuch perſons conſider the common duty of Charity, of lending without expectation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, according to Chriſts Doctrine, <hi>Love ye your Enemies, and do good for evil, and lend hoping for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again, and your reward ſhall be great, and ye ſhall be the Children of the higheſt, for he is kind to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, and to the evil, be ye therefore merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6.34, 35, 36. It were adviſable ſuch perſons would conſider, it's only Gods bounty, which makes one man in a worldly ſtate to differ from another, <hi>What haſt thou O man, that thou haſt not received? Every Good and every Perfect Gift cometh from the Father of Light,</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>The Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battel to the Strong, but God raiſeth up one and caſteth down another.</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65284:49"/> Let man in proſperity conſider, it is only by the favour of God he ſtandeth, <hi>and he that thinketh he ſtandeth let him take heed leaſt he fall.</hi> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>When thou Lord rebukeſt man for Iniquity, how doſt thou make his beauty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume like a Mothe?</hi> Let him conſider the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luke 16.19. to the end, and the rich Husbandman in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.16, to 22. Let him conſider <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Fall from the height of Glory, to a Brutal State, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch men remember they are of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and extraction with the pooreſt, that they owe their Life, Being, and what they have to God, and are eternally loſt, unleſs reconciled to God in Jeſus Chriſt, and that all men by Nature are under Wrath, and Debtors to Gods Juſtice, and if he ſhould prove a rigorous exactor who could ſtand before him? therefore they ought equally to have compaſſion on their Brethren. <hi>Remember them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them which ſuffer adverſity, as being your ſelves in the Body,</hi> Hebrews 13.3.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch remember the Parable of that cruel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, whoſe Lord forgave to him his debt, but he dealing cruelly with his fellow Servant, his Lord fell on him, and made him irrecoverably miſerable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23. to end; and theſe are Chriſts own words, <hi>ſo likewiſe ſhall my Heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Treſpaſſes,</hi> Mat. 18.35.</p>
            <p>It being ſo known a Truth, and fatal to Mankind, that all Men in <hi>Adam</hi> were concluded under Sin and Wrath, and that woful experience as well as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach us. That all men (except Chriſt) are frequently defiled with actual Tranſgreſſions; And that no man acquainted with himſelf can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Eecleſ.</hi> 7.20,</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65284:49"/>
            <p>And that as all men in <hi>Adam</hi> are under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Wrath and Juſtice, ſo the only way of Salvation is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Romans.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
            <p>Now that all naturally are under the ſtate of Sin, let us conſider the duties incumbent for our recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of this condition, and theſe are chiefly five. Firſt, Trace Man what he is in his Eſtate of Nature. Secondly, Let us ſet Original Sin before us as a Beacon. Thirdly, Study Mortification. Fourthly, Study Repentance. Fifthly, Search into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God and believe them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Duty is to trace Man from his beginning, of whom if we take a view, we will find him ſoon after his Creation to fall from his Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by breaking the command and eating the forbidden fruit, <hi>And the Lord ſaw that the wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Heart was evil and only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5, 7. And ſee how he is deſcribed by the Prophet. <hi>The Heart of Man is deceitful and deſperately wicked above all things, who can know it,</hi> Jeremiah 17.9.</p>
            <p>See how Man is painted out in his natural defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thy Father was an Amorite, and thy Mother a Hittite as for thy Nativity, in the day that thou waſt born, thy Navel was not cut, neither waſt thou waſhed in Water to ſupple thee, thou waſt not waſhed at all, nor ſalted at all, no Eye pittied thee, to do any of theſe things to thee, to have compaſſion on thee, but thou waſt caſt out on the open fields to the loathing of thy perſon, in the day thou waſt born,</hi> Ezek. 16.3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See more of this under the head of original ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, all our unrighteouſneſſes are as filthy-Rags, we do all fade away as a Leaf, and our Iniquities like a Wind have taken us away,</hi> Iſa. 64.6.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65284:50"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me,</hi> Pſal. 51.5.</p>
            <p>He is accurſed of God, for as many as are under the Law are under the Curſe, <hi>For it is written, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every Man which continueth not in every thing which is written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Deut. 27.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Set Original Sin as a Beacon before us, The uſe of a Beacon is to take directions how to ſteer a right Courſe, to avoid ſplitting on a Rock or danger, or upon Invaſion to avoid ſurprizal by Enemies, how great reaſon hath Man in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his loſt happineſs by ſin, to avoid ſplitting on that Rock again? Remember <hi>Lots</hi> Wife ſtruck up into a Pillar of Salt, for looking back to ſinful <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19.26. The Paſſover was appointed to remember the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that the Lord by his Power had reſcued them from their Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 13.3. The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> in 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. chapters of his Prophecies holds forth to us the natural and rebellious frame of Mans Spirit, which we ſhould always have under our Eyes.</p>
            <p>The third Duty incumbent is Mortification of all ſins and corruptions, actual and habitual, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever quality or degree. And that</p>
            <p>Firſt, by applying our ſelves to Chriſt by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Waſh me and I ſhall be clean, purge me and I ſhall be whiter than Snow; create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me,</hi> Iſa. 51.7, 10. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally defiled muſt be cleanſed by him, <hi>For he is made to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. of this more at large hereafter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Get a ſelf loathing for ſin, <hi>we are all as an unclean thing, from the ſole of the foot to the top of the head,</hi> and with holy <hi>Job</hi> abhor thy ſelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65284:50"/> in Duſt and Aſhes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>ch.</hi> 64.6. <hi>Job</hi> 42.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Get deep apprehenſions of the Infinite and free love of God in Chriſt. And that firſt in his early Mercy of Mans Redemption, and Promiſe after Mans Fall, <hi>it ſhall bruiſe thy head and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. And admire his infinite goodneſs of free Mercy <hi>When we were without ſtrength, Chriſt in due time died for the ungodly. God ſo loved the World, that while we were yet Sinners and Enemies, Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 8.5, 6, 9. This is that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel</hi> which was promiſed for Redemption of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>ch.</hi> 11.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 53. all.</p>
            <p>The fourth Duty is Repentance, which is a Godly ſorrow for ſin not to be repented of, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Apoſtles deſcription hath theſe ſeven qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Carefulneſs,</hi> which is an Impartial diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſearching into all the Thoughts and Actions, concealing none, nor conniving at any thing of Sin, though as dear as right Eye, or right Hand, <hi>If thy right Hand offend cut it off, if the right Eye offend pull it out, it is profitable that one member periſh rather than the whole Body. He that loveth Father, Brother, or Child, better than me, is not worthy of me, he that loſeth his Life ſhall find it, and, he that ſaveth his Life ſhall looſe it, and he that taketh not up his Croſs, and followeth not me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 5.29, 30. Mark 9.44.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Clearing your ſelves.</hi> That is, not only to part with what Luſts we pleaſe, and confeſſing what ſins we are indifferent to part with, but ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning our ſelves according to the ballance of the Sanctuary, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> not by the level of affection and intereſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p>A Third is <hi>Indignation,</hi> To hate every ſin with an implacable prejudice, even to hearing, ſeeing, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65284:51"/> handling, or any ſort of communication or delight in ſin, with an abhorence as infectious; can any touch Pitch and not be defiled? with aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as an infectious Plague, jealous as of the Wiles of the Devil, as Intanglements and Fetters.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Zeal;</hi> With great anxiety, after a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diſcovery of every ſin in its blackeſt dreſs, in its Nature, Root, Branches and Tendencies, zeal for full purging, and waſhing, not leaving Root or Branch of any Sin unmortified or ſubdued; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tampering or liſtning to new affinities, or terms of recon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iliation, or inticements, hotly and warmly purſuing every Sin, to utter death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Vehement deſire,</hi> Like one curious to paint to the Life. the Nature, Monſtruous ſhape, and miſchievous quality of every ſin, as well in its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs to, and deteſtableneſs with God, <hi>(who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity)</hi> as in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>neſs to Man, expoſing him to the wrath of God, and barring him from entring into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem, <hi>where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as the only Enemy of Mans Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs, and blaſting with a Curſe all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments, and the diſturber of the Peace of Mans Conſcience, in a Communion with God, and diverts him from enjoying of God, in place of Luſt and Sin.</p>
            <p>The Sixth qualification, is <hi>Fear,</hi> Watching and Praying leſt we enter into temptation, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mindful that the ſubtile Enemy of our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Devil goeth about night and day, like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> And therefore in watching <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> Eph. 6.14, 15, 16. and watch over our Thoughts, Words, and Actions, having a continual Eye on the Enemy without, as a Sentry ſtanding in view of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65284:51"/> Camp day and night, obſerving the voice of all Gods Providences and Diſpenſations, not putting the evil day far from us, but being on our watch with oyl in our Lamps, and our Lamps burning, knowing that the Bridegroom cometh as a Thief in the night, not knowing what hour he will come, and therefore to be always ready leſt when he comes we ſleep, and that the door of Mercy may not be ſhut on us for ever, <hi>Mat</hi> 24.14.</p>
            <p>The Seventh qualification of true Repentance, is <hi>Revenge,</hi> Holy revenge conſiſteth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t a reſtleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of ſin, and not only giving up all ſociety with it, and entertainment of it, and contradicting or implacable prejudice and hatred to it, but alſo knowing that corruption and ſin is ſuch an infect, and that of venomous Nature, that every piece and crum will excite to a new Rebellion againſt God. And therefore by a holy re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Duty incumbent to Man, in order to Eternal Life, is to ſearch the Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and believe them, all men are anxious to have good Titles to their Eſtates, and to know them; how much more ought Chriſtians, to be ſolicitous for the knowledge of ſacred Records, to inſure their Intereſt of ſomething with Chriſt. Chriſts Promiſes to his People, are either for things Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65284:52"/> firſt of things Spiritual, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered under theſe three,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The free love of God, in ſending Chriſt a Ranſom for Sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All ſuitable graces and ſpiritual bleſſings, given by God to the called according to his promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Eternal Life and Salvation given to all who believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, Scriptures are full of the Records, of Gods free love in redeeming Man by Jeſus Chriſt, when Man was in no condition to make terms for himſelf, and that early inſtance of Gods compaſſion on Man when he had ſo ſoon fallen from his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>I will put enmity between thy Seed and her Seed, It ſhall bruiſe thy head and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. Here is a clear promiſe of the Meſſiah, of victory over Sin and Satan. <hi>And when we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for us, and when we were yet ſinners.</hi> And that compaſſion of God, when Man was contemptible, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, and <hi>no Eye pitied thee, to do theſe things to thee, and when I paſſed by, thy time was the time of Love, and I ſaid to thee live, yea I ſaid to thee live,</hi> And that Evangelical Invitation, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come to me, drink of the Waters of Life, buy wine, and milk, without money, and without price, come to me, and I will make your Souls live, and make an everlaſting Covenant with you. Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his wickedneſs, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon him,</hi> Iſa. 55. to 8.</p>
            <p>This ſtrain, conſtant current, and Ocean of free Love, flows upon free terms, upon the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and without any terms, or expectation of any return from Man, but freely without recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65284:52"/> 
               <hi>I am found of them that ſought me not, I am ſought of them that asked not for me,</hi> Iſa. 65.1, 2. From all which may be ſeen that great myſtery of the Love of God to Sinners, which paſſeth underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing in ſpiritual bleſſings, is Gods furniſhing Believers with all ſuitable Graces, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and Indowments, <hi>And we know, that all things work together for good, to them that love God, who are called according to his purpoſe; for whom he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, them he alſo did Predeſtinate, to be conformed to the Image of his Son, He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not alſo with him freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.28, 29, 32. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, neither hath Ear heard, nor hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee O Lord) what great things he hath laid up for thoſe, who wait on him,</hi> Iſa. 64.4. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given, ſeek and ye ſhall find, whatſoever ye ask the Father in my name, believe ye have them, and they ſhall be given you,</hi> Mat. 7.7.</p>
            <p>The laſt inſtance of divine bounty, is Eternal Life. <hi>To them who by patient continuance and well doing ſeeketh for glory, and honour, eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2.9. <hi>When Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he ſent his only Son, that whoſoever ſhould believe in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>And the glory that thou gaveſt me I have given them, that they may be one as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that the World may know, that thou haſt ſent me, and loved them, as thou haſt loved me,</hi> Joh. 17.22, 23. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the end, and I will give thee the Crown of Life, To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, I will give to ſit down in my Kingdom, even as I have overcome, and am ſat down with my Father in his Kingdom,</hi> Revel. 3.21.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of Gods Promiſes, are of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65284:53"/> Mercies, or of Temporal and Spiritual mixed together, and theſe in Scripture are extended to all the exigencies of a Chriſtians ſtate or condition. As Firſt in general afflictions, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them, in his Mercy and in his pity he redeemed them, and bore them all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways, they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, left thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone,</hi> Pſalm 91.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In all particular trials and afflictions, <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorough the Waters I will be with thee, and thorough the Rivers they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt thorough the Fire thou ſhalt not be burned, neither ſhall the flame come upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 43.2. <hi>And he ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him, I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him, with long life will I ſatisfy him, and ſhew him my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Pſal. 91.15, 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Promiſes in greateſt extremity when left and forſaken of all Friends and Relations, <hi>When my Father and my Mother forſake me, then the Lord will take me up.</hi> Pſal. 27.10. <hi>Can a Woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her ſucking Child, and not have Compaſſion on the fruit of her Womb, yea they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, behold I have graven thee upon the Palms of my hands, thy Walls are continually before me,</hi> Iſa. 49.16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he ſaw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no Interceſſor, therefore his own Arm brought Salvation to him, and his fury upheld him,</hi> Iſa. 63 5. <hi>All thy lovers have forgotten thee, they ſeek thee not, for I have wounded thee with the wound of an Enemy, with the chaſtiſement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, becauſe thy ſins were increaſed, why cryeſt thou for thine affliction? thy ſorrow is incurable, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, becauſe thy ſins were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65284:53"/> therefore all they that devour thee, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and all thy Adverſaries every one of them ſhall go into Captivity, and they that ſpoil thee, ſhall be a ſpoil, and all that prey upon thee, ſhall be a prey, for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore health unto thee, and heal thee of thy wounds ſaith the Lord, becauſe they have called thee an out-caſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is</hi> Zion <hi>whom no Man looketh after,</hi> Jer. 30.14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed the manifold Promiſes of God to his People. Let us now conſider the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to be taken by repenting ſinners under their afflictions which may be in this threefold Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider Sin as the cauſe of all Evil and of Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all Afflictions are from God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider Gods Intention and Purpoſe towards his People, by afflicting of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Conſideration, is that ſin, as it's the cauſe of all evil, is alſo the cauſe of affliction, no man is ſo inſenſible, but he finds the burthen of affliction, or ſhould be ſo irrational as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cauſes thereof, ſo that if we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the firſt Chaſtiſement which hapned to Man, to wit, his being ſhut out from Paradiſe, we will find the cauſe thereof to be his Rebellion, and Diſobedience to God, in eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, and as we muſt acknowledge the Juſtice on Gods part, ſo all the Scriptures all along ſhew Sin to be the cauſe of Affliction, <hi>Hear O Heavens, and hearken O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken, I have nouriſhed and brought forth Children, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt me, the Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters Crib, but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do nor conſider, O ſinful Nation, a People loaden with Iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, Children that are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65284:54"/> corrupters, they have forſaken the Lord, they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to anger, they are gone away backward, why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more, the whole head is ſick, the whole Heart is faint, from the ſole of the foot to the top of the Head there is no ſoundneſs in it; but wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores, they have not been cloſed, nor mollified with ointment; your Country is deſolate, your Cities are burned with Fire, your Land Strangers devour in your preſence, and it is deſolate as overthrown by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> Iſa. 1.2, to 8. <hi>O Lord the hope of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>all that forſake thee ſhall be aſhamed, and they that depart from thee ſhall be written in the duſt, becauſe they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee the fountain of living Waters,</hi> Jer. 17.13. Where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorce, whom I have put away? behold for your Iniquities have you ſold your ſelves; and for your tranſgreſſions is your Mother put away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, We ought to conſider that Affliction ariſeth not out of the Duſt, but directly or indirectly they are from God, is there any evil in the City that the Lord hath not done? <hi>Job.</hi> 5.6. You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I puniſh you, for all your <hi>Iniquities,</hi> Amos 3.2, 3, to 7. Who gave <hi>Jacob</hi> to the ſpoil, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Robbers, did not the Lord, he againſt whom we have ſinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to <hi>his Laws,</hi> Iſa. 24.24. I form Light and create Darkneſs. I make Peace and create War, I the Lord do <hi>all theſe things,</hi> Iſa. 45.7. All thy lovers have forſaken thee, they ſeek thee not, for I have wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee with the wound of an Enemy, with the Chaſtiſement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy Iniquities, becauſe thy ſins were increaſed, I have done theſe things unto thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65284:54"/>
            <p>The third conſideration, is what may be Gods purpoſe or intention in chaſtiſing his own People, which may be reſolved and comprehended in theſe five.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To purge away their ſins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To invite his People to Repentance, by with-holding his Face by afflictions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To diſtinguiſh between his Children and Baſtards.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To fix on their Hearts, the ſenſe of the emptineſs of humane enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To poſſeſs them of the true opinion of Chriſts excellency above all things elſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is to purify his People from ſin, <hi>waſh you, make you clean, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, if ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured by Fire, thy Silver is become droſs, thy Wine mixed with Water, ah I will eaſe me of my Adverſaries, and avenge me of my Enemies, I will turn my Hand upon thee and purely purge away thy droſs, and take away thy Tin,</hi> Iſa. 1. to 26. By this therefore ſhall the Iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his Sin, when he taketh away all the Stones as Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 27.9. I have refined thee, but not with Silver, I have <hi>choſen thee in the furnace of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Iſa. 48.10.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Branch of Gods purpoſe in afflicting his People, is, to call his People to him by his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his countenance from them by afflictions, either on their Perſons or Subſtance. <hi>I will go and return to my place until they</hi> repent and ſeek my Face, in their afflictions they will ſeek me early, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. Therefore behold I will hedge up thy way with Thorns, and make a Wall that ſhe ſhall not find her Path, and ſhe ſhall follow after her Lovers and not overtake them, ſhe ſhall ſeek them, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65284:55"/> not find them, then ſhall ſhe ſay I will return to my firſt Husband, for then was it better with me than now, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, to 10. Standing Waters ſtink, and Mettal not uſed or ſcoured corrupts, and as the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith by rubbing, filing, or fire, purifieth and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The third Branch of Gods purpoſe of Afflictions upon his People, is to diſtinguiſh between his own peculiar People, and the Wicked, which are called Baſtards. And that by a fatherly reſtraining their extravagancies by moderate correction. <hi>Though I make a full end of all Nations whether I have ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure and not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed,</hi> Jer. 30.11. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he Chaſti eth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth, for if ye endure chaſtiſement, God dealeth with you, as with Sons, for what ſon is he, whom the Father Chaſtiſeth not?</hi> but if ye be without chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof all are partakers, then are <hi>ye Baſtards and no Children, Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. Behold happy is the Man <hi>whom God correcteth,</hi> Job 5 17.</p>
            <p>The Prodigal had never returned but for his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury and Want, this is Gods chief means to reclaim his People, to hedge up their way with Thorns, <hi>I will melt them and try them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p>The fourth reaſon of Gods purpoſe in chaſtiſing his people is to fix on their Hearts, the true belief of emptineſs of humane enjoyments.</p>
            <p>The Lord having a purpoſe to unite his People to himſelf, and finding their inclinations running after creature enjoyments, as cogenious with their natural Appetites, he draws them thence, not by neceſſity, or conſtraint, but in choice, by his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65284:55"/> chaſtiſements to fix on their ſenſes and experience the emptineſs of all humane enjoyments. And that by theſe two reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are not our own, but given or lent to us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are certain troubles, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Comforts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Worldly and Earthly enjoyments, as well as Spiritual Mercies, are not ours, but all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, that all the enjoyments of this Life are but precarious from God, at his pleaſure, to give and continue them with us, or us with them, is a truth, in experience without contradiction, and needs no proof, though there are Scripture proofs ſufficient. Naked came I into the World and naked ſhall I return, the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. We brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ſhall carry nothing away with us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. And Chriſt ſaying to the Rich Man in the Goſpel, thou fool this night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee, then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be that thou haſt? <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19, 20.</p>
            <p>Nay more, Man in his natural and intrinſick capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is of all Creatures the moſt weak impotent, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and miſerable of himſelf, the Beaſts of the Field can crawl, ſeek their food, ſupply themſelves, but Man is ſo feeble, that unleſs help be adminiſtred to him at his Birth, and a long while after he muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
            <p>And this clearly appears from Scripture. <hi>In the day thou waſt born, thou waſt not waſhed at all, nor ſwadled at all, thy navel was not cut, thou waſt in thy blood caſt out into the open Field, to the loathing of thy perſon, no Eye pittied thee, to do any of theſe things unto thee, and when I paſſed by, it was the time of love, and I ſaid to thee live, when thou waſt in thy blood,</hi> Ezek. 16.1, to 7.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65284:56"/> This is the true and lively deſcription of Man in his natural ſtate and condition, whereby every Man hath cauſe of lowlineſs of mind, and no man hath cauſe to boaſt, glory, or claim any thing of his own, but to acknowledge, that all things even in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, are given to him of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing whereby the Father of Life, and God of all Wiſdom, teacheth his people to the low eſteem and contempt of the World by their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to inſtruct them that the things of this Life are uncertain comforts, and certain troubles, and this is manifeſt in all humane experience, in all ages, and all the train of enjoyments clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this.</p>
            <p>If we take a view of all Worlds goods, and its excellency, as they are computed by the Apoſtle, <hi>The Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15, 16, 17. If we will branch them forth in the ſeveral particulars of honour, riches, health, friends, relations, and all the other pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excellencies of humane Life or Enjoyments, and examine all the pretenders to theſe injoyments ſince the World began, we ſhall find none who have not experienced the uncertainty of theſe enjoyments, and the anxiety and trouble attending the having of them; of all the Men on Earth, none could lay a greater claim to enjoyments of all kinds, than could <hi>Solomon,</hi> let us ſee then, what account he gives thereof. <hi>I was great and encreaſed</hi> more than all that went before me, and whatſoever my Eyes deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I kept not from them, I with-held not my heart from any Joy, for my Heart rejoiced on all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then I looked on all the works my hands had wrought, and behold all was vanity, and vexation of Spirit, and <hi>there was no profit under the Sun,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.2. chap. 2. all.</p>
            <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65284:56"/>
            <p>Let us ſee the experience of <hi>David,</hi> a Man in great honour, and in favour with God, <hi>Thou haſt made my days as an hands breadth, and mine age as nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, every Man at his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39.5, 6. <hi>Surely every Man walketh in a vain ſhew, ſurely they are diſquieted in vain, he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who ſhall gather them.</hi> Pſal. 62.9. <hi>Surely Men of high degree are vanity, and men of low degree are a Lye, to be laid in the Ballance they are all together lighter than vanity?</hi> Pſal. 144.4.</p>
            <p>But this will be more palpable if we diſſect the World or its enjoyments in its particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Honour, ſecondly Wealth, thirdly Friends or Relations, fourthly Health or Strength, and we ſhall find uncertainty of enjoyment, anxiety, and trouble attending all and every of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Honour, As it is only the airy applauſe of Men, and depends on humane and vulgar eſteem, how doth daily experience prove the inſtability thereof, all Ages ſee a Man in honour this day, and in diſgrace the next, what uneaſineſs are men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ſupport and continue the Idol of vain glory? Do Men ſtick at any acts of injuſtice, cruelty, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or oppreſſion, to ſupport their Dagon of Pride or vain glory? yea do not theſe Idolaters of vain glory, rather than outlive the ſlippery ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of this World, with <hi>Achitophel,</hi> often become their own Murderers, at once ignominiouſly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their life and honour? the too many inſtances of this kind, and the immediate foregoing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tell us, that of all things worldly honour and glory, is the moſt ſhadowy and fantaſtical folly of humane Life. <hi>Man is like to vanity, his days are like a ſhadow that periſheth away. Man that is in honour is like the beaſt that periſheth,</hi> Pſalm 144.4. Pſalm 49.12, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Riches are the ſecond branch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65284:57"/> enjoyments, and how uncertain they are, and what anxiety they bring upon a Man to acquire and keep them, none can pretend ignorance, who are indifferently converſant in the World.</p>
            <p>See the account Chriſt gives thereof, <hi>That it is eaſier for a Camel to go thorough the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſee for this the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the Fool in the Goſpel, Mat. 19.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 19, 20. See the Apoſtle Pauls account of Riches: we brought nothing into this World with us, and we ſhall carry nothing out of it, but they that will be rich, fall into many temptations, and a ſnare, and many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which draw Men into deſtruction and perdition, for the love of Money is the root of all evil, which while ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves thorough with many ſorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>The third branch of humane enjoyments is Friends or Relations, and although deſireable Friends and Relations, be one of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of humane Life, yet how uncertain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietful this alſo proves, and often the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, is evident; yea an injury from a ſtranger is comportable, when unkindneſs, or any ill office from a Relation, is a heart breaking affliction. <hi>For it was not</hi> an Enemy that reproached me, then I could have born it, neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify himſelf againſt me, then I could have hid my ſelf from him, but it was thou a man, mine equal, my guide and my acquaintance, we took ſweet Counſel together, <hi>and walked unto the Houſe of God in Company.</hi> Pſal. 55.12, 13, 14. It was not only <hi>Shimei</hi> but <hi>Abſolom</hi> who were unfaithful to <hi>David,</hi> and proved his greateſt affliction, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5, to 13.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65284:57"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> found greater trouble from his three friends Impeachments of hypocriſy, and from his Wives tempting of him to curſe God and dye, than from all his other trials, but this is the frequent caſe of Chriſt and his Saints, Chriſt was betrayed by one of his own Diſciples, and <hi>Paul</hi> accuſed by falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> gives ſufficient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat againſt relying on Friends or Relations. <hi>Truſt not in a Friend, put no confidence</hi> in a guide, keep the Door of thy Lips, from the Wife that lieth in thy Boſom, for the Son diſhonoureth the Father, and the Daughter riſeth up againſt the Mother, and the Daughter in Law againſt the Mother in Law, and a Mans Enemies are thoſe of his own Houſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.5.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee, how the ſureſt pretenſions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane enjoyments, are, and prove often as the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Reeds of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not only fail ſuch as lean to them, but moſt frequently ſplinter and gaul rather than comfort.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing of humane enjoyments, is Mans Life, Health, and Strength, and how brittle this is all men can teſtifie. <hi>When thou rebukeſt Man for his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> thou makeſt his beauty to conſume <hi>like a Moth. It is appointed for all Men once to dye,</hi> and what a Load is Man to himſelf? obnoxious to ſo many viciſſitudes, compoſed of ſuch different parts, and elements, that no man can keep a calm within himſelf, or can reſiſt the aſſaults of God, and the exigence of his Lot, how many loathſome diſtempers is man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto, by the natural Imbecillity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?</p>
            <p>And how irreſiſtible are the Armies which invade him, in his Mind and Body, and how frail is Man if once God frown upon him, and what defence can he make, if the Armies of the Almighty aſſault him? what Man is he then, who can boaſt of any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65284:58"/> thing of his own, except Sin, Corruption, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. <hi>Therefore let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man in his wealth, but he that glorieth, let him glory in this, That he knoweth me who exerciſeth Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, and Loving Kindneſs in the Earth, for in theſe things I do delight ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing deſigned by Chriſt in afflicting his People, is to make them ſenſible of his own dignity and excellency, above all created enjoyments, and that in theſe ſix reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is of himſelf, and all things elſe from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is infinite in Power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Infinite in Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Matchleſs in Beauty.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Of everlaſting Continuance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conquerour over all Enemies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If we do duly conſider the value of objects, Reaſon and Intereſt will enduce the choice of the worthieſt; and what can bar, but we muſt approve of Chriſt as the only choice, eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, in all and every of theſe his incomparable excellencies, and as to the firſt Creator of all things, no Creature can hold proportion with the Creator, we muſt in our choice give the preheminence to Chriſt, he is <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> by him and for him were all things created, and by him all things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, he is of himſelf and all things elſe from him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Infinite in Being, Eternal, and Infinite in Power, <hi>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the hollow of his hand, and metted out the Heavens with his Span, and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, all the Nations of the Earth are as a drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ſmall Duſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65284:58"/> of the Ballance, behold he taketh up the Hills as a very little thing, all Nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity. He is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings. And his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is without end or limitation of time, he is glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes doing wonders,</hi> Iſa. 40.12, to 18. Pſalm 68.17. Revelation 17.14. Exod. 15.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is infinite in Wiſdom, <hi>who hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the</hi> Spirit of the Lord or being his Couſellour taught him? with whom took he Counſel, and who inſtructed him, and taught him the Path of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Knowledge, and ſhewed him the way of underſtanding? he is Prince of Peace, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſellour the everlaſting Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13, 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. to 11.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He is matchleſs in Beauty, <hi>He is the Roſe of</hi> Sharon, <hi>White and Ruddy, the choiceſt of ten thouſands,</hi> His Head as the moſt fine Gold, his Locks are buſhy and black as a Raven, his Mouth is ſweet, yea he is altogether lovely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10, to 17.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He is of everlaſting continuance, all created Beings are either tainted with inherent, and natural defects, or imperfections: Riches canker and conſume, beauty failes with the complexion, friends, power, and humane glory, are <hi>Solomons</hi> vanities, and periſh in the uſing, or are cut off with time, but he made all things, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end, he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> Rev. 1.8.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, He is abſolute Soveraign and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all Enemies, even of Death and the World, <hi>be of good-Comfort,</hi> I have overcome the World, the Iſſues of Death belong to him, he hath the Keys of the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> he can ſhut and no man open, he can open and no man ſhut, <hi>I am he that liveth and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65284:59"/> was dead, and behold I live for evermore and have the Keys of Hell and Death,</hi> Rev. 1.8. chap. 5.9.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh reaſon why the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth afflict and chaſtiſe his People, is to exerciſe their Faith and Patience, upon his Promiſes to them in their afflictions. It being the Lords way with his People, to afflict them to trials and confirmation, not to their deſtruction or overthrow, to chaſtiſe them in Meaſure, and not to leave them altogether unpuniſhed, <hi>for I am with thee ſaith thee Lord to ſave thee,</hi> Jer. 30.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though I make a full end of all Nations, whether I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee, but will correct thee in meaſure, and not leave thee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unpuniſhed.</hi> The Lord knoweth the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his People, and therefore deals warily and gently with them, by his afflicting hand he intends not their deſtruction, but to frame them for Veſſels of Love and Mercy, he intending they ſhall be the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, he refines them and chuſeth them in the Furnace of Affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction, to ſcoure off the natural and ſinful uncleanneſs; And thus he deals in a tenderly and fatherly way. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 9.7. <hi>In meaſure when it ſhutteth forth, I will debate with it, he ſtayeth the rough wind in the day of his Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and all his Billows do not blow at once,</hi> Jer. 27.7, 8, 9. He will not overcharge them, but propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Phyſick of Affliction to the ſtrength he will give them. <hi>No temptation hath befallen you but what is common to Men, the Lord is faithful who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above meaſure, but with every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will give an outgate, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> 1 Cor. 10 30. 2 Cor. 4.17, 18. And therefore the Wiſe Phyſician of Souls, <hi>who will not break a bruiſed Reed, nor quench a ſmoaking Flax.</hi> Iſa. 42.3. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the diſcouragement of the Chriſtian Patient in their afflictions, affords them the Cordials of his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65284:59"/> Infallible Promiſes, to ſtay, ſupport, and uphold them, againſt the ſoureſt gripings of Temptations and Trials, which is his Fatherly Potion, that he meaſures to them in this Life. And theſe Promiſes are ſuited to all the Chriſtians Lot on this ſide of time, as well to their Spiritual State, Trials and Difficulties, as to that of the Temporary Troubles and Afflictions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>And Firſt for their Spiritual ſtate in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In Spiritual darkneſs and deſertion of Gods preſence, for their Cloudineſs in the ſenſe of Gods favour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Under the ſenſe or apprehenſions of greateſt Sins. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Under repeated Sins or Relapſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In Darkneſs and Soul Deſertion, as every throw or gripe to the diſeaſed, do diſcompoſe and aggravate, ſo much more, when afflictions, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty are upon any, and that their Spiritual ſtate is clouded, and they have not the comfortable preſence of God, ſo as they are under fears, and darkneſs, that the Lord is not their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or cannot be ſatisfied that theſe Chaſtiſements are in Mercy, and not in Wrath, from the Hand of a Father, how is the Soul hurried, and curdled like a Cheeſe, and roars with <hi>David</hi> as diſtracted with terrours, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> this of all conditions is the moſt anxious and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as on the other hand when the Countenance of a reconciled God in Chriſt Jeſus, looks thorough the deepeſt Cloud of Afflictions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Soul rejoyceth in Tribulation. <hi>Some will ſay who will ſhew us any good? but Lord lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance, which will make our Soul more joyful and more glad, than when their Corn and Wine encreaſe in great abundance.</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7, 8. And in this doleful ſtate, the Lords
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65284:60"/> Promiſes are rich and manifold. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light; let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. <hi>Unto the Righteous there ariſeth light in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſal. 112.4. <hi>Light is ſowed to the Righteous, and Joy to the Upright in Heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not, I ſaid behold me, behold me, unto a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was not called by my name, before they call I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking I will hear ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 65.1, 24. <hi>Before ſhe travelled ſhe brought forth, before her pain came ſhe was delivered of a Man Child, and as ſoon as</hi> Zion <hi>Travelled ſhe brought forth her Children, ſhall I bring to the Birth, and not cauſe to bring forth, ſhall I cauſe to bring forth, and ſhut the Womb ſaith the Lord?</hi> Iſa. 66.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>The great Phyſitian of Souls, like a juſt and wiſe Phyſitian, uſeth ordinary means in common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, but in extremities and dangerous Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Cordials, and Rich and Choiceſt Medicines are not with held, when all ordinary helps fail, his ſpecial Love and Power manifeſts it ſelf, when we were helpleſs, yea Enemies, he brings ſuccour, comfort and relief, and makes with us an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. to 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Thus he ſheweth his Prerogative of curing, as well as his Love, when no other help appears, when my Father and my Mother forſake me, then the Lord ſhall take me up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>chap.</hi> 63.5.</p>
            <p>The Sheepheard of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is that tender hearted Phyſitian, who ſympathiſeth with his People, In all their Afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſayed them. In his Love and his Pity he Redeemed them, and bore them all the days of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. His compaſſion is great, his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65284:60"/> Bowels yearn, and are turned for them, how ſhall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> how ſhall I deliver thee <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> how ſhall I make thee as <hi>Adma,</hi> how ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim,</hi> my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.8. Is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpoke againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Am I a God at hand and not a God afar off?</hi> Jer. 22.23. The Lord cannot forget his People, though the Cloud of darkeſt afflictions, may hinder their apprehenſions of his love, and care of them, <hi>I have even called thee by</hi> thy name, though thou haſt not known me, I am the Lord and there is none elſe beſides me, I guarded thee, though thou haſt not known me, I Form the Light and Create Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all <hi>theſe things,</hi> Iſa. 45.4, 5, 7. He healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds, wherefore although the pale and dark ſide of the Croſs, ſhould look grim upon the Chriſtian, he is by Faith and Patience to look thorough the Cloud, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, and lay hold of him in his Promiſes; <hi>though the Viſion tarry,</hi> wait for it, it will ſpeak at laſt, and he that will come, ſhall come and will not tarry, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>No Man did look thorough a paler Cloud than this Prophet, <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vine, though the labour of the Olive, and the Fields ſhall yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there ſhall be no Heard in the Stall, yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation, the Lord is my ſtrength, and he will make my Feet like Hinds Feet, and he will make me to walk upon my High Places,</hi> Hab. 3.17, 18, 19. The holy Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> after he had viewed the folly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65284:61"/> of all humane expectations, weakneſs, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of friends, relations; and all other Men, puts his confidence alone in God, and thereby takes great courage and reſolution, and ſeems to make Inference of Faith, upon the view of humane va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. <hi>Therefore I will look unto the Lord,</hi> I will wait for the God of my Salvation, my God will hear me, rejoyce not againſt me O mine Enemy, when I fall I ſhall ariſe, when I ſit in darkneſs the Lord ſhall be a light unto me, He will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.1, to 11.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch of Gods Promiſes to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is of his great Mercy, Love, and Reconciliation under the greateſt Sins, the Lord doth not meaſure his diſpenſations as Men do their benevolences, by ſcanty meaſures, and do pardon leſſer and not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er offences, for that Sins of the deepeſt dye are no bar to his Mercy, <hi>He came not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> In the Language of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the whole need no Phyſitian, but the Sick, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.31, 32. His Invitation is <hi>look unto me and be you ſaved all the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>And come unto me all ye that labour and</hi> are heavy loaden, and <hi>I will give you reſt,</hi> Mat. 11.28.</p>
            <p>My Thoughts are not as your Thoughts, neither your Ways my Way ſaith the Lord, for as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my Thoughts higher than your Thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 55.8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come now let us reaſon together ſaith the Lord, though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be made white as Snow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool. If you be willing and obedient ye ſhall eat the good of the Land, but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with fire,</hi> Iſa. 1.18, 19 20.</p>
            <p>Chriſt makes a free Market of Mercy, and puts no limitation to his bounty, but offers freely upon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65284:61"/> the Sinners acceptance by Faith and Repentance; <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth come</hi> to the Waters, buy Milk, and Honey without price, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. his ſatisfaction is for all, and for all manner of Sins, upon Faith and Repentance. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> that whoſoever ſhould believe in him, ſhould not die, but have eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. Chriſts love is free, and reſpects not the greatneſs of Sin, but the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Faith and Repentance, yea, <hi>When we were Enemies and without ſtrength Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Davids</hi> uncleanneſs and Murther of <hi>Uriah</hi> was no bar to Divine Mercy, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.29. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> on Repentance found Mercy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Idolatry, Witchcraft, and other great Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations received Mercy on Repentance, and <hi>When He</hi> was in great affliction, he ſought the Lord, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him, and heard his ſupplication, and brought him again to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and into his Kingdom, <hi>Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Promiſes upon Relapſes, although it is ill complexion to ſin after receipt of Mercies, as with the Dog to the Vomit, and the Sow to the Mire, yet Repentance in its due qualifications gives a riſe to Mercy. The Lord had to do with the moſt ſtubborn People on the whole Earth, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from God in moſt heinous manner. And yet how often did he renew his Mercies to them? the whole tract of the Iſraelites Life was Rebellion and Revolts, nevertheleſs he regarded their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, when he heard their cry, ſee their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings and the Lords wonderfully renewed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. all.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:65284:62"/>
            <p>The Lords wonderful free and early Mercies were eminently manifeſted to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nevertheleſs, ſee their ſtupid revolt, and ingratitude, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him and converted all his kindneſs and mercies to the feeding of their luſts and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Idolatry, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. from 15, to 37. Wherefore the Lord in his Juſtice ſends them under ſevere puniſhments, to <hi>verſe</hi> 60. and then the Lords anger is pacified towards them, and he remembers his Covenant with them, when they are aſhamed of their ſins and abominations, and return to the Lord by Repentance, to the end of the chapter. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords Ear is always open to the cry of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinner, <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him in Truth,</hi> Pſal. 145.18. Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine, why will you dye O Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for I have no pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth ſaith the Lord, wherefore turn your ſelves and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25, to 33. <hi>chap.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>As the Lord doth exerciſe the Patience of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Spiritual Promiſes for Spiritual things, ſo alſo to truſt his Promiſes in reference to temporals, and theſe may be branched out in theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His Promiſes to the People of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without reference to particular caſes of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and theſe comprehend God's complex or full purpoſe to his People.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe Promiſes may relate to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes or exigence of Gods People.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For Gods Promiſes in general not relating to particular caſes, the Scriptures are ſo full, that it's impoſſible to collect them, however we ſhall touch
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65284:62"/> ſome of the moſt obvious, <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them in his Love and in his Pitty he remembred them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9.</p>
            <p>His Anger endureth but for a moment, ſorrow may be at Evening, but Joy cometh in the morning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. For thou Lord wilt bleſs the Righteous, with favour wilt thou compaſs him as with a Sheild, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.12. The Lord will be a refuge for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, a refuge in time of trouble, for they that know thy name will put their truſt in thee, for thou haſt not forſaken them that ſeek thee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.9, 10. Though you have lyen among the Pots, yet ſhall ye be live a Dove, whoſe Wings are covered with Silver, and their Feathers with yellow Gold, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.13. For thou Lord wilt ſave the afflicted People, but wilt bring down high looks, he is a buckler to all thoſe that truſt in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.22, 30. unto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs, ſurely he ſhall not be moved for ever, the righteous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance, he ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings, his Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4, 6, 7. Alas for that day is great, there is none like it, it is the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> troubles, but they ſhall be delivered out of them all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.7. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſets down in many places Gods univerſal care over his People. O <hi>Iſrael</hi> fear not for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine, when thou paſſeſt through the Waters I will be with thee, and through the Rivers they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt thorough the Fire; thou ſhalt not be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither ſhall the flames kindle upon thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. all. The Lord will be a Sun and a Sheild, he will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5, 13, 15. The holy Pſalmiſt is full
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65284:63"/> of Prophetical Promiſes of Gods univerſal good to his People, he that dwelleth in the ſecret of the Moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, I will ſay of the Lord, he is my Refuge and my Fortreſs, my God in him will I truſt, ſurely he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the Fowler, and from the noiſome Peſtilence, he ſhall cover thee with his Feathers, and under his Wings ſhalt thou truſt, his truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. all.</p>
            <p>And of the numerous and large Promiſes of God to his People, and of the Halcyon days of <hi>Zion,</hi> all the Prophets abound, for the Law ſhall go forth of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the word of the Lord from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhall judge many people, and the Nations afar off, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhears, and their Spears into pruning hooks, Nation ſhall not lift up a Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more, but they ſhall ſet down every man under his own Vine, and under his own Fig tree, and none ſhall make them afraid, for the Mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it, I will aſſemble her that halteth, and her that is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, and her that I have afflicted, and I will make her that halted a Remnant, and her that was caſt far off, a ſtrong Nation. And the Lord ſhall reign over them in <hi>Zion,</hi> from henceforth and for ever, <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt go even to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and there thou ſhalt be delivered, there the Lord ſhall redeem thee from the hand of thine Enemies. Ariſe and threſh O Daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> for I will make thy Horn Iron, and thy Hoofs Braſs, and thou ſhalt beat in pieces many People, and I will conſecrate their gain and their ſubſtance to the God of the whole Earth, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. all. Awake, awake, ſtand up O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which haſt drunk at the hand of the Lord, the Cup of his fury, thou haſt drunk the dregs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65284:63"/> of the Cup of trembling and thou haſt wrung them out, there is none to guide her amongſt all the Sons whom ſhe hath brought forth, neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the Sons whom ſhe hath brought up, theſe two things are come unto thee, who ſhall be ſorry for thee? deſolation, and deſtruction, the Famine and the Sword by whom ſhall I comfort thee? thy Sons have fainted, they lye at the head of all the Streets, they are full of the fury of the Lord thy God, therefore now hear this thou afflicted and drunken, but not with Wine. Thus ſaith the Lord the God, and thy God, that pleadeth the cauſe of his People, behold I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the Cup of my fury, thou ſhalt no more drink it again, but I will put it into the hands of them that afflicted thee, who have ſaid to thy Soul, bow down that we may go over, and thou haſt laid thy body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.17, to end.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpoke againſt him, I do earneſtly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him ſtill, my bowels are troubled for him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. Thus ſaith the Lord, becauſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath ſaid againſt you, a hah! made you deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and ſwallowed you up for a poſſeſſion, to the Heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are in Infamy to the People, and are a prey and deriſion. I have ſpoken in my Jealouſie, and my fury, becauſe ye have born the reproach of the Heathen, ye ſhall ſhall ſhoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit, for behold I am for you, and ye ſhall be tilled and ſown, I will multiply you, and ſettle you after your old Eſtates, and I will do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you than at your beginning, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, I will take you from among the Heathen whether I have driven you, and I will
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65284:64"/> bring you into your own Land, then will I ſprinkle you with clean Water, and you ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols, a new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the Stony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you a Heart of Fleſh, and I will put my Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. all.</p>
            <p>He that ſpared not his own Son, but freely gave him up to death for us all, how ſhall he not alſo with him freely give us all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 31. to the end. I am perſuaded that neither Death nor Life, things preſent nor things to come, nor Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties nor Powers, nor Height nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, to the end. Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened, for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9. Thou calledſt in trouble and I delivered thee, I anſwered thee in the ſecret place of Thunder, I proved thee at the Waters of <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> Exod. 17.6. The People of God are his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and he dwells amongſt them, therefore he aſſiſts, comforts and protects them, <hi>For ye are the Temple of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And are built upon the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone, in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto a Holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye alſo are builded together for an habitation of God thorough the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>Chriſt is as a Sun over his Houſe, whoſe Houſe

            <p>The great Phyſitian of Souls hath not only offered his temporal Mercies in general afflictions, but alſo hath proportionate his Promiſes to the particular Caſes and Conditions of his People in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which may be chiefly in theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Under Sickneſs, Weakneſs, or Infirmities of Old Age.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Poverty, Want or Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Under Captivity, Reſtraint or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Under Revilings, Reproaches or Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Under unkindneſs, or forſaking from Friends or Relations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In <hi>Sickneſs or Weakneſs,</hi> As it is Chriſts own ſaying in another ſenſe, <hi>what hath a Man profited if he gain the whole World and looſe his own Soul?</hi> So it may be ſaid, what comfort can a Man have of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Friends, Riches, and all other enjoyments of the World, when by Sickneſs, Infirmity, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decay and Weakneſs, he is not able to find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of theſe Enjoyments, his Palate is ſo out of order, that all are inſipid and taſtleſs to him; And as its ſaid by Chriſt, <hi>What ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul;</hi> what will not the greateſt Miſers the Lovers of Honour, or Wealth, give to eaſe the gnawing pains of a lingering and loathſome Diſeaſe, when by ſickneſs or pain all the Channels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort are ſtopt, and a Man can have no breathing, but is tortured and racked by fainting fits; or tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains, how cheap would he ſell all his pretenſions to breath freely, and he eaſed of his Pains and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65284:65"/> which drain all the Faculties from the Senſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Uſe of any other enjoyments. And how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the richeſt, wiſeſt, moſt honourable, and beſt related, when the Heart is ſtunned with faintings, and the body with torturing pains, nevertheleſs, this is the Chriſtians comfort, that there is <hi>Balm in</hi> Gilead, <hi>and a Phyſitian in</hi> Iſrael, and one who not for filthy lucre, but one who of free love, hath not only promiſed to cure them, but alſo never to leave, nor forſake them; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Am I a God at hand and not afar off, he is preſent when trouble is near,</hi> Jer. 23.23. <hi>Behold I will bring it health and cure, I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of Peace and Truth, I will reſtore health unto thee, I will heal thee of thy wounds, becauſe they call thee an outcaſt, ſaying this is</hi> Zion, <hi>whom no Man ſeeketh after,</hi> Jer. 30.17. <hi>Which are born by me from the Belly, which are carried from the Womb, even to your old Age, I am he, even to your hoar hairs will I carry them, I have made and I will bear, even I will carry and I will deliver you,</hi> Iſa. 46.3.</p>

            <p>Secondly, In <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> As all Afflictions for the time, are grievous and not joyous, Reſtraint or Impriſonment wants not its aggravations, for that it reſtrains a Man from that freedom of Nature in converſe, which is moſt deſirable by Man, as the Philoſopher defines him to be a ſociable Creature, It reſtrains him from the Comfort of ſuch in whom he delights, Relations, Friends, and Acquaintance, It deprives him of the Improvement of his Talent, for Religion, or Vertue, for God, his own Family and Common-wealth. It abridgeth his Comfort in other Enjoyments, It leſſens health, creates ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and oppreſſeth the vitals, often to fatal effects, and here in this Houſe of Darkneſs, the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to ſupport his People by manifold Promiſes, either of deliverance, or his ſtrength and preſence, to comfort and uphold them, and often to both, He <hi>is King of Kings</hi> and Lord of Lords, and all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given to him, in Heaven and in Earth, he hath the Keys of Hell and Death, he openeth and no man ſhuts, and he ſhutteth and no man openeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>He executeth Judgment for the oppreſſed, who giveth food to the hungry, the Lord looſeth the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65284:66"/> Priſoner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.7. The Lord upholdeth all that fall and raiſeth up all that be bowed down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.14. He made them to be pittied of thoſe that carried them away Captives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.10 Then they cried unto the Lord, and he delivered them out of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, ſuch as ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death, being bound in Afflictions &amp; Irons, he brought them out of Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death, and broke their Bonds aſunder, he ſent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.6, 10, 14, 20. The Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Poor and deſpiſeth not the Priſoners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.33. Thus ſaith the Lord, I will bring again the Captivity of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Tents, and have mercy on his dwelling place, and the City ſhall be built upon her own heap, and the Pallace ſhall remain after the manner thereof, Behold I will bring them from the North Country, and they ſhall come, with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and with ſupplication will I lead them, I will cauſe them to walk by the Rivers of Waters, by a ſtraight way, wherein they ſhall not ſtumble, for I am a Father to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> is my firſt born, he that ſcattered <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will gather him as a Shepherd doth his Flock, for the Lord hath redeemed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ranſomed him from him that was ſtronger than he, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.18. A Voice was heard in <hi>Rama,</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and bitter weeping, <hi>Rachel</hi> weeping for her Children, refuſing to be comforted, becauſe they were not, thus ſaith the Lord refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears, for thy Work ſhall be rewarded and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy, there is hope in thine end, that they ſhall come again to their own Borders, <hi>Jer</hi> 31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, to 23. And the Heathen ſhall know that the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went into Captivity, becauſe they treſpaſſed againſt me, therefore hid I my Face from them, therefore thus ſaith the Lord,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65284:66"/> now will I bring again the Captivity of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and have mercy upon the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I will be jealous for my Holy Name, after that they have born their ſhame, and all their treſpaſſes, that they have treſpaſſed againſt me, when they dwelt ſafely in their own Land, and none made them afraid. And I am Sanctified of them, in the ſight of many Nations. Then ſhall they know, that I am the Lord their God, which cauſed them to be led into Captivity, among the Heathen, but I have gathered them into their own Land; and have left none of them any more there, neither will I hide my Face any more from them, for I have poured out my Spirit upon the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezekiel 29.23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Behold I will gather them out of all Nations, and all Countries whether I have driven them, in mine anger and in my fury, and in great wrath, and will bring them again to this place, and will cauſe them to dwell ſafely, and they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God; and I will give them one Heart and one Way, that they may fear me, for the good of them and their Children after them: Yea I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will moſt aſſuredly plant them in this Land, with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul, for as I have brought all this great evil upon this People, ſo will I bring upon them all the good that I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.37, to end.</p>
            <p>Turn ye to the ſtrong hold, ye Priſoners of hope, even to day, do I declare unto you, that I will render double unto you, they ſhall be as the Stones of a Crown lifted up, as an Enſign upon his Land, for how great is his goodneſs, how great is his beauty, Corn ſhall make the Young Men chearful and the new Wine Maids, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.12, to the end.</p>

            <p>Thus ſaith the Lord after ſeventy years be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed at <hi>Babilon.</hi> I will viſit you, and perform my good words towards you, and cauſe you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to this place, for I know the Thoughts that I think towards you, Thoughts of Peace and not of Evil, to give you an expected end: you ſhall call on me, go and pray, and I will hearken unto you, ye ſhall ſeek me, and find me, when ye ſeek me with all your Heart, I will be found of you, and turn away your Captivity, and gather you from all the Nations, and all places whither I have driven you, and bring you again to the place, whence I cauſed you to be driven away Captive, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.10, to 15.</p>
            <p>And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return to <hi>Zion,</hi> with everlaſting Songs and Joy upon their Heads, they ſhall obtain Joy and Gladneſs, and Sorrow and Sighing ſhall fly away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39.10.

God ſetteth the ſolitary in Families, and bringeth out thoſe that are bound with Chains, but rebellious are in a dry Land. As we ſee from the foregoing Scriptures the manifold Promiſes of God for the delivery of his Priſoners of hope, the ſame inſtruct us alſo of the Lords great Power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his delivering of his People in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By giving to them a more lively appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and diſcovery of himſelf, under their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than formerly, and affords them more patience and courage to bear their Afflictions and Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Priſons or places of Retirement, and as at all times, we ſhould examine our caſe, as to peace with God, and ſeeing all afflictions are from God and Confinements eſpecially, for the good of ſuch
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65284:67"/> as wait on him, we ought in Priſon Houſes to ſearch our Hearts, and try our Ways, and ſeek out the Cauſes of Gods ſo dealing with us, and by this means, he maketh the darkeſt Priſons the happieſt Lodgings, by the effects it works on ſuch as therein walk with God and ſeek reconciliation with him in Jeſus Chriſt, we ſee what clear revelations <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> had, when ſhut up in cloſeſt Priſons and Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and with what undaunted Zeal and Courage for God he delivers the Meſſage of God, when he was moſt ſeverely dealt with, being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by God againſt all diſcouragements, ſee <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 32.2. and 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 33. and 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 37.16. <hi>ch.</hi> 38.4.5, and 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 39.16, 17, 18. <hi>ch.</hi> 42.10.</p>
            <p>See the conſtancy of Zeal and Courage of the three Children, when they knew the Law againſt them was irrepealable, <hi>Be it known to the oh King, we will not obey thee, nor worſhip the Image which thou haſt ſet up,</hi> Dan. 3.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>How did <hi>Peter</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, being in Priſon, maintain the Cauſe of Chriſt, when being forbid to Preach any more in the Name of Chriſt, thus reaſoned, <hi>Whether it be better to obey God or Man, judge ye,</hi> for we cannot but ſpeak the things that we have ſeen <hi>and heard,</hi> Acts 4.3, 9. How joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and chearful were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> in Priſon, after they had been ſoundly whipt, for Preaching in the Name of Jeſus, by Praying and Singing of Pſalms in the hearing of other Priſoners, how are all the Books of the Hiſtories of the Chriſtians Perſecutions, as well under Heatheniſh as Roman Tyranny, full of the chearfulneſs of Chriſtians in their Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Truth, ſo as many have been offered their Lives, who rather did chuſe to ſuffer Death, than to live and be under greater Temptation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By making Enemies Mediators for his People, and Inſtruments of their Deliverance, the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65284:68"/> Lord put it in the Heart of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe Anceſtours had kept the Iſraelites Captive ſeventy years, to ſend them back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with Inſtructions to rebuild the Temple at his Charge, and reſtored to them the Veſſels took out of the Temple. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was enlarged and delivered by the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he was impriſoned by his own Native Prince, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.11, 12, 15. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were brought out of Priſon by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by whom they were ſhut up, and the Jailor waſhed their wounds and entertained them in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By delivering of his People by his own immediate Hand, <hi>And the Angel of the Lord opened the Priſon Doors, and brought them forth, and ſaid to them go forth, and preach to all People the words of this Life,</hi> Act. 12.13. The ſame Apoſtle alſo delivered by an Angel, the Doors and Iron Gates opening of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and his Chains falling off, and he and <hi>Sylas</hi> delivered by an Earth-quake, all which ſhew the Lords ſpecial care over his Priſoners of Hope, which invites all ſuch to a patient waiting on God, <hi>Believing the Viſion is for an appointed time, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. He made them to be pittied of thoſe that carried them captive,</hi> Pſ. 106.46.</p>
            <p>The third caſe wherein Gods Promiſes do ſupport his People is <hi>Poverty,</hi> or which the Scriptures abound, the Holy Jeſus who is truth it ſelf tells us, <hi>That Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the Mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4.4. And that his ſpecial Providence and care is the only ſupply of his People, as he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reth for the Lillies provides for the Ravens and Sparrows, ſo taketh he care of his People; however the Lords Promiſes to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Poverty are large. <hi>When the Poor and needy ſeeketh Water, and there is none, and their Tongue fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65284:68"/> for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not forſake them, I will open Rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of the valleys, I will make the Wilderneſs a Pool of Water, and the dry Land ſprings of Water,</hi> Iſa. 41.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will give thee the Treaſures of Darkneſs, and hidden Riches of Secret Places, that thou mayeſt know, that I the Lord, which call thee by thy name am the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.3. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, without money, and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. <hi>The Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfy thy Soul in drouth, and make Fat thy Bones, and thou ſhalt be like a Watered Garden, and like a Spring of Water, whoſe Waters fail not,</hi> Iſa. 58.11.</p>
            <p>Though Poverty pincheth, and Straights are ſore Trials, yet conſider and believe Gods Providence and Care of his People at all times, either in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their wants in his own time and way, or bleſſing what they have, and increaſing a little to a great deal.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In ſupplying their wants, ſee the Lords ſupply of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> when his Mother laid him out of her ſight, not willing to ſee him dye for want of Drink. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.16, to 21.</p>
            <p>The Lords feeding his People with Manna for Bread, and Quales for Fleſh from Heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. The Lords making Water to ariſe out of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſs, to preſerve <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Life, <hi>Jud.</hi> 15.9. The Lords feeding of <hi>Eliſha</hi> by ſending of food to him by a Raven, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17. The Lords won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful relieving the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſtrongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged and oppreſt with Famine, when Women did eat their own Children, and in one Night brought it great plenty by his wonderful Providence, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7. all.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65284:69"/>
            <p>Secondly, By bleſſing and encreaſing a little to a great deal, <hi>The little that a Righteous Man hath, is better than the Riches of many wicked,</hi> Pſal. 37.16. The wonderful encreaſing of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi>'s Oil, and Barrel of Meal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the feeding her ſelf; her Son, and the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> many days, when ſhe thought to have ſtarved for want, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. The Lords preſerving <hi>Eliſha,</hi> forty days and forty nights, by two ſingle Meals, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19. The Lords making a ſmall quantity of Oil to encreaſe to many Barrels, and thereby relieved the Widows two Sons, who were to have been ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d for the payment of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers debt, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 4 all. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt his feeding of five thouſand Men, beſides Women and Children, with five Loaves and two ſmall Fiſhes, and after all were ſatisfied twelve Baskets full of Fragments were taken up, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.42, 43, 44.</p>
            <p>And to conclude this point, ſee what Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency ſaith, <hi>Prove me now ſaith the Lord, if I will not open the Windows of Heaven, and pour out a Bleſſing, that you ſhall not have room to receive it,</hi> Malachy 3.10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth Affliction or Trial of Chriſtians, in which God aſſiſteth his People by his Promiſes is the <hi>unkindneſs, unnaturality or change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of friends,</hi> as this is a great trial, yet it is the frequent Lot of Chriſtians, Chriſt the Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not only forſaken of his Friends, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by one of his own Diſciples, <hi>Job</hi> was charged with Hypocriſy by his three Friends, and tempted by his Wife to Curſe God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had his Throne Uſurped by his own Son, and his Wives defiled by him in the ſight of the Sun, <hi>Moſes</hi> was accuſed of uſurpation by his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Siſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> Numb. 11.4. and daily experience proveth, that a Mans Enemies are thoſe of his own Houſe, however the Lords Promiſes for Comfort

            <p>See the Pſalmiſts Caſe, Thou haſt put away my acquaintance far from me, thou haſt made me an abomination to them. I am ſhut up, I cannot come forth, I am afflicted from my Youth, and ready to dye, while I ſuffer thy Terrours I am diſtracted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.8, 15, 18.

            <p>Conſider the Churches ſtate, there is none to plead thy cauſe, all thy lovers have forgotten thee, they ſeek thee not, in which we ſee the height of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, of unnaturality of Relations, but conſider in that ſame and often repeated place, The Lords wonderful kindneſs, therefore all they that devour thee ſhall be devoured and all thy Adverſaries eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them ſhall go into Captivity, for I will reſtore health unto thee and heal thee of thy wounds, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11, to 18.

The Church in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s time was under contempt, reproach, and forſaken of friends, but yet, he comforts her with great aſſurances of Gods everlaſting favour, fear not for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, thou ſhalt forget the ſhame of thy Youth, and not remember the reproach of thy Widow-hood any more, for thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name, and thy Redeemer, the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the Lord hath called thee as a Woman forſaken and grieved in Spirit a Wife of Youth, when thou waſt refuſed, for a little moment have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercy will I gather thee, in a little wrath I hid my Face from thee, for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs, will I have mercy upon thee, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5, 6, 7, 8, And farther when all help failes and no appearance of any hope, then the Lord Interpoſeth. I looked and there was none to help, I wondered that there was none to uphold, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine own arm brought Salvation and my Fury it upheld me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.5. This alſo was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, I looked on my Right Hand, and beheld, but there was no man would know me, refuge failed me, no man careth for my Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4.</p>
            <p>This alſo was the great caſe of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord interpoſeth with his great deliverance, but <hi>Sion</hi> ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me, my God hath forgotten me, but behold the Lords Fatherly

            <p>The fifth inſtance of Gods kindneſs to his People, is when <hi>under great reproaches,</hi> as a good name is better than Gold and Pretious ointment, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the holieſt and moſt innocent of Gods People, have been expoſed unto, and are obnoxious to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, revilings, and reproaches from the worſt of Men.</p>
            <p>Chriſt the Lord of Glory, was called a Wine-bibber, a Drunkard, a Friend to Publicanes and Sinners, and charged with having a Devil, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Charmer by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of Devils, and at his Death, was reviled as a deceiver, and they that paſſed by railed on him, thou that ſaveſt others come down from the Croſs and ſave thy ſelf, he that ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.29, 30, 31. <hi>Luke.</hi> 7.33, 34. <hi>ch.</hi> 11.15.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were called rebellious turners of the World upſide down, ſtirrers up of the People and Inventers of new doctrine.

            <p>I was a reproach amongſt all mine Enemies, eſpecially to my Neighbours, and a fear to mine acquantance, they that did ſee me fled from me, I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind, I am

Falſe Witneſſes roſe up againſt me, they laid to my charge things I knew not, they rewarded me evil for my good to the ſpoiling of my Soul, in my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, they rejoiced and gathered themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea the Abjects gathered themſelves together againſt me, and I knew it not, they did tear me and ceaſed not, with Hypocritical mockers at Feaſts, they gnaſhed upon me with their Teeth, yea they opened their mouth wide againſt me, and ſaid, a ha! a ha! our eyes have ſeen it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.11, to 22.

            <p>Mine Enemies ſpeak evil of me, when ſhall he die, if he come to ſee me, he ſpeaketh vanity, he gathereth iniquity to it ſelf, and when he goeth away he telleth it, all that hate me whiſper toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt me, they did deviſe my hurt, now that he lieth down he ſhall riſe no more, yea mine own familiar friend in whom I truſted, who did eat of my bread, did lift up his heel againſt me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.5, to 9.</p>

               <hi>Moſes</hi> the humble and meekeſt of Men, was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ambition and aſſuming of Arbitrary Power, even by his Brother <hi>Aaron</hi> and Siſter <hi>Miriam, Thou takeſt too much upon thee, hath the Lord ſpoken by</hi> Moſes

               <hi>only, hath he not ſpoken by us alſo?</hi> Numb. 12.1.2.</p>
            <p>This alſo was Chriſts Lot, <hi>My Brethren have dealt deceitfully with me as a Brook,</hi> John 13.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This alſo was the ſad Condition of the Church, <hi>Thou haſt heard their reproach O Lord; their Imaginations againſt me, the Lips of thoſe that riſe up againſt me, their devices againſt me all the day long, behold their ſitting down and their riſing up, I am their Muſick,</hi> Lam. 3.6, 62, 63. <hi>David was as among Lions, their Teeth were as Spears againſt him; and their Tongues as ſharp Swords, they wreſted his words,</hi> Pſal. 57.4.

            <p>The ſixth reaſon, why God thus chaſtiſeth his People, is to make them ſenſible of the different meaſures, by which he deals with his People in their Afflictions, and with the wicked by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, and that conſiſts in theſe ſix reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He chaſtiſeth his People in love and for their good, but his Judgments on the Wicked, are to their Everlaſting Loſs and Condemnation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He unwillingly and with reluctance corrects his People, but taketh pleaſure in his Juſtice upon the Wicked.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He corrects his People in meaſure and moderation, but Rains down the Vials of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure upon his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Chaſtiſements of his People are but for a moment, and not to make an end of them, but the Wicked are totally cut off, without expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hope of recovery.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Godly though afflicted are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65284:72"/> by Gods preſence, they have communion and fellowſhip with the Father and holy Trinity, but the Wicked have no hope in their end or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Godly by their afflictions are taught to know the difference between Spiritual and Carnal enjoyments, Temporal and Eternal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Godly's Chaſtiſements are for their good, although all Trials, Afflictions and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are a dark Cloud. and carry a pale Face, yet when the Godly do ſearch out the purpoſe of God in this, and are deſirous to know his Intentions therein, they will ſee this to be in love, when the Godly enjoy all ſenſual pleaſures without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they are apt to ſurfeit upon Mercies, and turn lazy and forget God, as the ſlothful Man by luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant feeding, eaſe, and gluttony contracts a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, ſo are the beſt of men, apt to forget the Fountain of Mercies, and wax wanton againſt God, as the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their quiet and plenteous enjoyments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15 <hi>ch.</hi> 17. <hi>Num.</hi> 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. Therefore the Lord viſits his People with Rods, to rouſe them out of their lazineſs to make them turn to their rock for their good and ſafety, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I learned to keep thy Word, bleſſed is the Man whom thou chaſtiſeth and teacheth out of thy Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67, 71.</p>
            <p>This is the end to the Godly to take away his ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth, If ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with Sons, for what Son is he whom the Father chaſtneth not? but if ye be without Chaſtiſement whereof all are partakers, then are ye Baſtards and no Children, we had Fathers of the Fleſh who chaſtiſed us after their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65284:72"/> own pleaſure and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits, and life? for they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a while corrected us according to their own pleaſure, but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holineſs: now no chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth joyous but grievous, but afterwards it bringeth forth the perfect fruit of Righteouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, to 12. But ſee the Iſſue of the wicked and ungodly, they ſhall be like the chaff which the Wind driveth away, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord doth not afflict his People willingly, but with great reluctancy, How ſhall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> how ſhall I deliver thee <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how ſhall I make thee as <hi>Adma,</hi> how ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> my Heart is turned within me, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting is turned together, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpoke againſt him, I remember him ſtill earneſtly, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. Repent and turn your ſelves from your tranſgreſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your ruin, caſt away all your tranſgreſſions, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit, for why will you dye O houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for I have no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, therefore turn your ſelves and live. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.34, 35. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord corrects his People in meaſure and not in extremity as he doth the wicked, hath he ſmitten him as he ſmote thoſe that ſmote him, or is he ſlain according to the ſlaughter of them that are ſlain by him, in meaſure when it ſhooteth forth thou wilt debate with it, he ſtayeth his rough Wind in the day of his Eaſt-wind, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Afflictions of the Godly, are but
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65284:73"/> for a ſhort time, for a ſmall moment have I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee, but with great mercy will I gather thee, in a little wrath I hid my ſelf from thee for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy upon thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5, 4.7, 8. They ſhall go into <hi>Babilon</hi> until I deliver them, I will viſit them there and reſtore them to this place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.22. Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work ſhall be rewarded, and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy, and there is hope in thine end, and thy Children ſhall come again in their own border, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Thus though the Lord deals ſeverely with his People, nevertheleſs it is but for a time; and in moderation, and giveth them a happy delivery, and eternal reſt with himſelf in the end, but he deals otherways with his Enemies, never withdrawing his Judgments from them, until he hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed their deſtruction, and avenged their malice againſt his People, Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs when the Lord hath performed this whole work upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> I will puniſh the ſtout-heart of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and the glory of his high looks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.15, 16.</p>
            <p>I was wroth with my People, I have polluted mine Inheritance, and given them into thy hands, thou didſt ſhew them no mercy, upon the antient haſt thou very heavily laid thy yoak, thou ſaidſt, I will be a Lady for ever, for that thou didſt not lay theſe things to thy Heart, neither didſt remember the latter end of them, therefore hear thou this, thou that art given to pleaſure, that dwelleſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, that ſayeſt in thy Heart, I am and none elſe beſides me, I ſhall not ſit as a Widow, neither ſhall I know the loſs of Children, but theſe two things ſhall come to thee in a moment, in one day, the loſs of Children and Widow-hood, they ſhall come
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65284:73"/> upon thee in their perfection, for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy Sorceries and great abundance of thy Enchantments. Therefore all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thee, ſhall be devoured, and all that prey upon thee, wi l I give for a prey, for I will reſtore health unto thee, and heal thee of thy Wounds, though I make an end of all Nations, whether I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee, but will correct thee in meaſure, and not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.7, 11, to 18. And they ſhall dwell ſafely therein and build houſes and plant vineyards yea they ſhall dwell with confidence, when I ſhall have executed Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on all them that deſpiſe them round about, and they ſhall know that I am their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.29. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25.26. Thou ſhalt ſeek them, but not find them, that contended with thee, they that War againſt thee, ſhall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.12. The Sons of them who afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, ſhall come bending unto thee, and they that deſpiſed thee, ſhall bow themſelves and the ſoles of thy Feet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 64.12, 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold I have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en out of thy hand the Cup of trembling, even the dregs of the Cup of my fury, thou ſhalt no more drink it again, but I will put it into the hands of thoſe that afflicted thee, which ſaid to thy Soul bow down, that we may go over, and thou haſt laid thy Body as the ground, and as the ſtreet to them that went over, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.21, 22, 23. They ſhall rob them that robbed them, and ſpoil thoſe that ſpoiled them, read <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 20. all. <hi>chapter</hi> 36. all. <hi>chapter</hi> 39. all.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The People of God in their afflictions have the comfortable preſence of God with them, but the wicked are wrackt and torn with anxiety, and diſpleaſure under Gods Judgmencs, <hi>In all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65284:74"/> he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pity he redeemed them, and bore them all the days of old,</hi> Iſa. 63.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that dwelleth in the ſecrets of the Moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſal. 91. all. <hi>When thou paſſeſt thorough the Waters I will be with thee, and through the Rivers they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou walkeſt thorough the Fire thou ſhalt not be burned, neither ſhall the Flames come upon thee, for I am the Lord thy God. Fear not for I am with thee, be not afraid for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will uphold thee, with my right hand of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for I the Lord will uphold thy right hand, ſaying fear not I will help thee, ſaith thy Redeemer the holy one of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſal</hi> 43.2, 3. <hi>chap,</hi> 44.10, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>The ſixth thing God intends in chaſtiſing of his People, is to teach them to diſtinguiſh between Spiritual and Temporal, Eternal and Temporary Mercies, this being one of the chiefeſt conſiderations, and proper for Mans direction in his choice of things, and uſeful for Man in his Converſation, how to chuſe things moſt deſireable, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things Temporal, and things Spiritual and Eternal under their ſeveral qualities, as they are contained in holy Scriptures, the holy Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> ſums up all the things of the World in theſe three heads, <hi>The Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life.</hi> It being uſual and natural to all men to ſeek and affect the enjoyment of what ſeems beſt to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore the great point of diſcretion, is to inform our Judgments what things are beſt, which will appear by comparing of things Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that are Eternal.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral qualities of Temporal things, may be briefly taken up from the foregoing Scripture in theſe heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All things Temporal or of this Life, are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65284:74"/> ſubject to changes and have no certainty or ſtability in them, but things Spiritual or Eternal are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All enjoyments of this Life are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and cannot make any man happy while he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th them, but Spiritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and things Eternal, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and make the Poſſeſſors happy in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All the excellencies of Creature enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are ſhort of the Eternal Inheritance of the Saints, which is Chriſt and Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All ſecular or temporary enjoyments, leave a Man at his Grave, but when this Life is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then cometh the Saints Eternal reſt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Things of this Life are uncertain and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the great Saviour of the World, Love, and Wiſdom it ſelf, being willing to inform the World and draw them off the uncertainties of periſhing things, in his great Sermon on the Mount adviſeth to <hi>Seek Treaſure in Heaven, where the Moth conſumeth not, nor the Thief doth purloyn,</hi> Mat. 6.19, to 34. See what account <hi>Solomon</hi> the greateſt, richeſt, and moſt honourable of all Men, giveth of all humane things <hi>All his days are ſorrow, his travel grief, his Heart taketh no reſt in the Night, this alſo is vanity, and vexation of Spirit continually,</hi> ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>See the uncertainty of humane things in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, Adonibezech, Ahithophel, Haman, Herod</hi> and many others, ſee <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30, to end, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. to 24. <hi>Eſther</hi> 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.20, to 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>We find in daily experience, a Man to day in Court like a green Bay Tree, and next in Diſgrace, Priſon, or Miſery. The Wicked ſhall periſh and the Enemies of the Lord ſhall be as the fat of Lambs, they ſhall conſume, into Smoak ſhall they conſume away, I have ſeen the wicked in great power and ſpreading himſelf like a green Bay Tree yet he paſſed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65284:75"/> away, and Lo he was not, I ſought him, but he could not be found, but the Lord knoweth the days of the Righteous, and his Inheritance ſhall be for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the enjoyments of this Life are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and cannot make happy. The foregoing truth of uncertainty, Demonſtrate this truth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and daily experience confirm it, the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and preſerving of Riches, acquiring, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs in upholding of Honour, care to preſerve and recover Health, do ſo Cruciate and Oppreſs Men with ſuch Anxiety, that all their Labour and Travel, is Sorrow and Trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And they have no Pleaſure, much leſs Happineſs in any Enjoyment, the Rich Man in the Goſpel, went from Chriſt ſorrowful, for that he could not hold his Riches and have Life eternal, the Scripture tells us, <hi>we brought nothing into this World with us, and it is</hi> certain we ſhall carry nothing out with us, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Food and Rayment, let us be therewith content but they that will be Rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown'd Men in Diſtruction and Perdition, for the love of Money, is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome covered after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themſelves through with many Sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all Humane Enjoyments are ſhort of Chriſt the Inheritance of the Saints, let us narrowly ſurvey with all the Advantagious Aggravations of Humane Excellency, all that can be pretended choice, good, or deſirable in the Creature and we ſhall find them, all ſhort to, and far exceeded by the inherent excellencies in Chriſt, the Lord of Glory, in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that all Created Beings have their riſe and being from him, and he alone is of himſelf, he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65284:75"/> is the firſt and the laſt, all things were made by him, and without him was nothing made, which was made, by him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and which are in Earth, viſible or inviſible; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, or Powers, all things were Created by him and for him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is, was, and alone ſubſiſts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd all other things were made by him, ſo by him do they ſubſiſt, in him we live, move, and have our being, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he is perfect himſelf, all things were made for him, and he not for them, <hi>all things were Created by him and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he excelleth all things in Antiquity, he is the Antient of Days the Firſt-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>and Firſt-born from the Dead, tbat in all things he might have the Preheminence,</hi> Col. 1.19.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in Wiſdom, he is Wiſdom it ſelf, and the Fountain of Wiſdom, in whom are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Knowledee and Wiſdom: <hi>If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all Men liberally and upbraideth not,</hi> read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, in Beauty, he is the Morning Star, <hi>the Roſe of</hi> Sharon, <hi>the Image of the inviſible God, who is the brightneſs of bis Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In power, he is Omnipotent, and all things elſe but of limited Power, <hi>he is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, in him dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Col. 2.9, 15.</p>
            <p>Who hath meaſured the Waters in the hollow of his Hand, and metted out Heaven with a Span, and comprehended the duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, who hath weighed the Earth in Scales, and the Hills
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65284:76"/> in a bal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nce, the Nations are as a drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the ſmall duſt of a Ballance, he taketh up the Iſles as a very little thing all Nations before him are as nothing, they are accounted to him leſs than nothing and vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 40.12, 15, 17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth difference between things Temporal and Eternal is that Temporal things leave a Man at his Grave, and in this Life; but Spiritual and Eternal continue with the Saints to all Eternity, So as when this miſerable Life is ended, the Saints are happy in their Death, and their Spiritual Life of bleſſed enjoyments then begins, <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which dye in the Lord, they ceaſe from their Labour, and their works follow them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
            <p>Theſe Spiritual enjoyments are not ſeen or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Carnal ſenſe, but are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and are eternal. While we look not after things that are ſeen, but after things which are not ſeen; for things which are ſeen, are Temporal, but things that are not ſeen, are eternal. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. The Kingdom of Heaven conſiſts not in Eating and Drinking, chambering and wantonneſs, Ryotting and Drunkenneſs, but in Peace and Joy of the Holy Ghoſt. This State of Poſſeſſion of Spiritual things, is briefly comprehended under theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it Commenceth when all Humane Enjoyments fail and continueth to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is incorruptible, and not ſubject to changes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is a compleat fulneſs of all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, when Enjoyments of this Mortal Life leaves a Man at his Grave, after he hath experienced the uncertainty, vanity, and vexation of Spirit, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humane Enjoyments, then he enters upon the quiet poſſeſſion of Eternal Happineſs, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65284:76"/> Scripture, all the People of God are Sealed, Marked and Secured from after danger, and made firm Pillars in the Houſe of God eternally in the Heavens: hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, until we have ſealed the Servants of the Lord in their Fore-Heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. which mark is a white Stone and in it a new Name, the Name of Chriſt and the City of God, which is their being renewed by the Spirit of Regeneration, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17. They are under an everlaſting Covenant with God, I will make a Covenant of Peace with them, and it ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant, and I will place my Sanctuary amongſt them, for evermore, <hi>Ez.</hi> 37.26. There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that dyeth, yea, rather that is riſen again, and maketh interceſſion for us, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.1, 31, 34.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, the Lot of the Wicked, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have enjoyed their good things in this Life, like the rich glutton, they are confined to everlaſting wrath and miſery, Remember that thou in thy life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time receivedſt thy good things, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> his evil things, therefore thou art now Tormented, and he Comforted, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.20. to end.</p>
            <p>The Righteous are brought out of great Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have their Robes waſhed in the Blood of the Lamb, and are Cloathed with the Righteouſneſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves white in the Blood of the Lamb, therefore they are before the Throne of God, Day and Night to ſerve him in his Temple, and he that ſitteth on the Throne, ſhall dwell amongſt them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. to 18.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65284:77"/>
            <p>And on the other hand, the wicked are Chained in everlaſting Darkneſs, and tormented with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Torments, ſo that they deſire Death, rather than Life, if any Man Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, or receiveth his Mark in his Forehead or in his Hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God which is poured out without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into the Cup of his Indignation, and ſhall be Tormented with Fire and Brimſtone in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb, and the ſmoak of their Torments aſcendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no Reſt Day nor Night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12. to end. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.4. to end. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.8, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this State and Inheritance of the Godly is incorruptible, and therefore not Subject to chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or Alterations, Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath begotten us again into a lively Hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, unto an Inheritance Incorruptible and Undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in the Heavens for us, 1 <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1.3, 4. This is that Treaſure laid up, where Moth conſumeth not, nor Thieves can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyn, this is a State where no change, caſe, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, or things can alter, for I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this State is a State of Compleat Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we have formerly ſeen the emptineſs of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Temporary Enjoyments, That therein Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs cannot be expected, from the uncertainty, and vexatiouſneſs even under the Enjoyments thereof;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65284:77"/> but here in this State is fulneſs of Joy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Seventh and great end Chriſt hath in Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his People, is, that which is the great end of the Goſpel, which is to raiſe Mens Hearts up to, and fix their deſires, on that great prize of Salvation and Eternal Life, as all Actions of Men have their Scope at which they chiefly Level, this is the chief thing, and ought principally to be driven at, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

            <p>Firſt, this Great Salvation is for Gods Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is of all things moſt Profitable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt deſirable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It hath the greateſt Encouragements at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Prize contended for is unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by Mans Salvation ariſeth to God great Glory, for as Chriſt is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> and Firſt-Born of his Brethren, and though Originally perfect in himſelf, and Glorious without Addition from Creatures, being the expreſs Image of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whom the God-Head dwells bodily, by whom all things were made, and for him, and to his own Glory, and all things upheld by him; his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſuch, that he promotes Mans Happineſs, and ſets it before him as his own Glory, gave himſelf to Death for Man, and made himſelf the Captain of that great Salvation, by enduring all the Indignities of Human Contempt, and his Fathers Wrath, by perſonating Man, and taking the Chaſtiſements of his Sins upon him, and this he propoſeth as his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the Glory that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, diſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the Right Hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. As I live ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the Death of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but rather that he ſhould Repent and live, this being not only our Intereſt, but Chriſts Glory, how much, and chiefly ſhould we be concerned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this is Mans moſt profitable concern, all Men Level their Deſigns and Actions, to the moſt Advantageous Intereſt, and this of Eternal Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Advice is moſt profitable, What hath a Man profited, if he gain the whole World? thou Fool, this Night thy Soul ſhall be taken from thee,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65284:78"/> then whoſe ſhall theſe things be that thou haſt? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do ye ſpend Money for that which is not Bread and Labour, for that which ſatisfieth not?

            <p>Thirdly, As this is moſt Advantagious, ſo it is that in which moſt encouragement of help and aſſiſtance is offered and promiſed.</p>
            <p>The whole Book of the Holy Writ is full of the great promiſes, of Encouragement and Aſſiſtance to the People of God, in their purſuit of this great Salvation, yea, it is Chriſts great deſire, that all Men ſhould be ſaved, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her Brood under her Wings?</hi> Luke 13.34. Is it not, and hath it not been, the Courſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Care of Chriſt, all the Prophets and Apoſtles, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and bring Men to the Kingdom of God? Chriſt made a purchaſe of Sinners, but on his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, he is that kind <hi>Samaritan</hi> who Helps, Cures, Supplies, and Recovers, when other helps fail, when Prieſts, Levites, and others paſs by, without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion or Relief, he it is who of his own good will brings Deliverance, as we ſee in the often repeated Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.10 to 37. <hi>Eze.</hi> 16. to 9. When we were without ſtrength, yea, Enemies and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt dyed for us, ſo great is Chriſts Love to Sinners, that nothing can ſtop the Current of his Mercy from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. to 11.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Multitude of Sins do it not, I have blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out as a Cloud thy Tranſgreſſions, and as a thick Cloud thy Sins; return unto me, for I have Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the greatneſs of Sins cannot hinder his Love, though your Sins be as Scarlet, I will make them white as Snow, though they be red like Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will make them as Wooll, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.18. Let the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65284:79"/> Wicked forſake his way, and the Unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon, for as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my Thoughts higher than your Thoughts. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 55.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Cloudineſs and Darkneſs of Condition cannot do it, who is amongſt you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walketh in Darkneſs, and hath no Light, let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 50, 10. Come my People, enter into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhut the Doors about thee, hide thy ſelf for a Moment, until the Indignation be over-paſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. I will go and return to my place, untill they acknowledge their offences, and ſeek my Face, in their Afflictions they will ſeek me early, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.15. by all which we ſee the Lord in Mercy, often clouds his Face from his People not in Anger, but to rouſe them up to enquire into the cauſe of his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by Afflictions to ſet them more eagerly on returning to him by Repentance, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them with a healing in his Wings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, No Extremity of Condition can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Love of God to his People, he brings back the Captive, he raiſeth the Dead Bones, and cauſeth them to take fleſh and live, he unites divided Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are at Enmity, and Cements them in Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all which ſee, <hi>Eze.</hi> 37. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2, 25. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91. all.</p>
            <p>Neither Death nor Life, Heighth nor Depth, things preſent, nor things to come, Principalities nor Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Angels nor Men, nor any other Creature can ſeparate us from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, to 39.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The greatneſs of the Prize to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, ſhould raiſe our great purſuit of that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65284:79"/> to our Souls, the Holy Scriptures are full in the Enumeration of the many excellencies that attend that great Intereſt, that they are almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and it may be well applyed to that which the Holy Prophet ſaith, That Eye hath not ſeen, Ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (beſides thee O Lord) what good things, The Lord hath laid up for them that fear him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 64.4. However the great Salvation of Man, may be in ſome meaſure conſidered under theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's the reſtoring of loſt Man from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt State of Miſery, without power in himſelf, to a State of Happineſs in Chriſt Jeſus, in the Day thou waſt born, thy Navel was not cut, thou waſt in thy Blood, no Eye pittyed thee, thou waſt caſt out to the loathing of thy Perſon, but when I paſſed by, it was the time of Love, I ſaid to thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive, in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated place, <hi>Eze.</hi> 16. to 15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. to 10. wherein we have the perfect emblem of Mans Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in Nature, and by Sin, and the lively Diſcription of the love of God to loſt Man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All in this State are intituled to, and are made Heirs of all things, and called to an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Incorruptible, as in theſe foregoing Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. and 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.3 and 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are exempted from all manner of Evil, are happy in their Death, and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ſhall be no more Death, Sorrow, nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the former things are paſſed away, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14. to 18. <hi>ch.</hi> 21, 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they have all Compleat Happineſs and Fulneſs of Glory, are united to God in Chriſt Jeſus, and Crowned with his Crown of Glory, and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Inſeparable Fellowſhip of Chriſt, Saints and Angels, according to that great Scripture, that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65284:80"/> they all may be one, as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, I will that they may be with me where I am, to behold my glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. to 25. And for the Fellowſhip of the Saints with God, Chriſt Jeſus, Angels and juſt Men made perfect in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſee that often repeated place, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.22, 23, 24. Thus, this great Prize ſhould in the Apoſtles Exhortation, raiſe our Encouragement, to haſten our motion to the New <hi>Jeruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where for being compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes, let us lay aſide every weight which hang down, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and with patience run the Race, that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the glory was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, diſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God, Conſider him which endured ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sinners, leaſt ye be wearyed and faint in your Minds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>Thus as Salvation, Eternal Happineſs, the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and Undefiled Inheritance of all things, the inſeparable fellowſhip of the Holy Trinity, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Saints, is the undeniable Prize at the end of our Race, the Intereſt and valuableneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought to raiſe our conſtant, zealous, and patient purſuit thereof, for which, beſides what hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been ſaid, we have theſe manifold and ſuperex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Encouragements.</p>
            <p>Firſt, our Salvation is freely of Gods pure Love in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt made and redeemed the World, without Mans help.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65284:80"/>
            <p>Thirdly, We have the examples and inſtances of Chriſts great humiliation and ſufferings on Earth.</p>
            <p>Forthly, The different and ſure eſtate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed far more excellent and ſure than Mans Eſtate in his firſt Creation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The great Priviledges and Excellencies of the Saints in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God being infinite in Power, Wiſdom, and Holineſs, abſolute and perfect in himſelf, without the help or neceſſity of any humane Being, being to accompliſh his Soveraignty of himſelf, of his own free Will and for his Glory he made the World, and upholds it, <hi>Who is the Image of the Inviſible God, the firſt born of every Creature, by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in the Earth, Viſible and Inviſible, whether they be Thrones or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him and for him, and by him all things conſiſt. And to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Man, The World, and all things were freely made by Ood, ſo Man and the World are freely Redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt. This of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man by Jeſus Chriſt, being one of the moſt incomprehenſible myſteries of free love; It may be branched out thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is free, without paction or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any retribution or ſatisfaction, but meerly by love and good will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That this Salvation is to ſuch who are utterly incapable of helping themſelves, and in ſuch circumſtances as they are in moſt incapacities and diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it brings with it all means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſuitable ſupplies.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65284:81"/>
            <p>Fouthly, That it is compleat and full, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can leſſen the enjoyment, or bar the ſenſe of it, except obſtinate wilfulneſs, and a refuſing of the offer.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Method and Way by which this great Salvation is accompliſhed, to wit, by Chriſts taking on him the humane Nature, and in the fleſh ſuffered for Mans Tranſgreſſions, do much heigthen the miſtery of Redemption.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That the Mediator when he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated that great work, makes the Redeemed ſharers of his own and Fathers glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this Salvation is freely of love and good will, without paction of any recompence from ſuch as expect and receive the benefit of it, appears from theſe Scriptures <hi>for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23, 24, 25. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.29.30. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion,</hi> Rom. 9.15, 16. <hi>So that it is not of him that wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 5.8. <hi>In hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which God that cannot Lye hath promiſed before the World began, not by works of Righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> Tit. 3.5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Salvation is to ſuch as are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of helping themſelves and under moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, Chriſt is that charitable and kind Samaritan to the wounded man by the Thieves, who brings help when the Levite and Prieſt (whoſe Office preach charity) paſſed by without giving any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n inſtance of mercy and relief, when Man was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65284:81"/> to all imaginable miſery, in moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and helpleſs condition, where the bowels of mercy are liberally extended, and relief is brought from meer love and pity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. to 9. And that other famous Scripture demonſtrate the freedom and fulneſs of love, when Man was in the worſt of circumſtances, when we were without ſtrength, Chriſt died for the ungodly, God commendeth his love to us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us, for if when we were Enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved throug his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. to 12.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be a greater inſtance of love, pity, and compaſſion, than the relieving of one in a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtate, ſo that Chriſts redeeming of Souls is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled, who relieved Enemies, without their own help, or capacity to relieve themſelves, and that famous Scripture, of cauſing the Dead Bones to take fleſh, ſinews and life, and become a numerous hoſt, is a clear emblem of the Infinite and Free love of God and mans incapacity to relieve himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. And in that famous place of Gods inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing for his People, when all friends and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are treacherous and helpleſs, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.4, 5, 6. From all which we may ſee, the eminent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of Mans ſelf incapacity and miſerableneſs, and of the fulneſs and freedom of Gods Love, and early mercies for him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third excellency and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this great Salvation, is, that it brings with it all ſuitable helps and ſupplies to aſſiſt us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that great Salvation, we find the Apoſtle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to us Gods eternal purpoſe of Mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he reſolved to bring Man to a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his own Will and Image, <hi>For whom he did foreknow he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65284:82"/> Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many Brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29. Whereby we find God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have the ranſomed, and ſuch as ſhall be ſaved by Chriſts Blood, to be compleatly ſupplied with all things neceſſary to adorn and compleat that great Salvation, and this is moſt manifeſt in the Scripture, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not alſo with him freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>He will give Grace and Glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from ſuch as fear him: ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs thereof, then all things elſe ſhall be added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,</hi> Mat. 6.33. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no money come, come ye, buy and eat without money and without price and let your Soul delight it ſelf in fatneſs,</hi> Iſa. 55.1, 2. Here we find, a full, free, and cheap Market of all ſupplies, from whence may clearly be implyed, Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have his people whom he adopteth heirs of his Kingdom to be compleatly furniſhed with all things neceſſary thereunto.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth and ſixth may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in one, that this great ſalvation, is compleat and full, in that it hath the enjoyment of God, in union of the Father by the Son, in the Spirit, and the Heirs of that Inheritance are made ſharers of all Heavenly excellencies, <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> this is more particularly expreſſed by the manifold priviledges of the glorified Saints, and their bleſſed Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As it is the reſtoring of Man from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtate of miſery, and exalting him to the higheſt pitch of happineſs, as hath been already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe of that eſtate are entituled to all things as hath been alreardy ſhewed.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:65284:82"/>
            <p>Thirdly, They ſhall be exempted from all manner of miſery, ſorrow and grief, They have compleat happineſs, and enjoyment of all things as being eternally united to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt myſtical excellency of this great Salvation, is, in the method taken by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom in the accompliſhing of it, to wit, by Chriſt the Mediators taking upon him the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therein making an attonement for Sin in the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>This is ſo great a myſtery that it merits all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Jeſus Chriſt, though he was from the beginning and from all eternity, cloathed with all Majeſty and Glory, and the firſt born of all the Creation, the Heir of all things, by whom the World was made, and by whom it ſubſiſts, who being the brightneſs of the Fathers glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Perſon, and by himſelf upholding all things, the only begotten Son of God, whoſe Throne is in glory for ever more, who laid the Foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Workmanſhip of his Hands, nevertheleſs, according to the Counſel of his own Will, he abaſed himſelf, to enter into a Virgins Womb, and came into the World, and under the infirmities of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuffered the higheſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> indignities, that the vileſt wretches could have been expoſed unto.</p>
            <p>And at laſt though he knew no ſin, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto Death, to make ſatisfaction for our ſins, this is that myſtery which was hid from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.9. This is the riches of the glorious myſtery of love to the Gentiles, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26. Chriſt the hope of glory. And oppoſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is ſaid by the holy Prophet and Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (beſides thee O Lord)
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65284:83"/> what great things he hath treaſured up for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.3. And though the Tongues of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, are not able ſufficiently to expreſs and unfold this great myſtery, nevertheleſs we may ſincerely view it, in theſe four heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The unſearchable dimenſions of the love of God to Sinners, in his eternal purpoſe of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World by Jeſus Chriſt, before the World began, <hi>To make all men ſee, what is the fellowſhip</hi> of the myſtery which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By his greateſt and almoſt incredible humiliation, in abaſing himſelf, to deſcend from the higheſt pitch of glory, to the loweſt ſtep of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane miſeries, temptations, ignominies and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that humane nature could be expoſed unto, and to make himſelf a Servant, in his ſojourning in the World to teach the Goſpel, and the myſtery of this great Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His further condeſcention of abaſement to the Wrath of God, and ſuffer death for Mans Sin, though he knew no ſin, that by his Suffering, Death and Reſurrection, he might not only by ſatisfaction of Juſtice for Man, redeem him from wrath to come, and procure him eternal happineſs; but alſo to be a patern of patience and obedience to all for whom he ſuffered, and both theſe laſt heads are contained or expreſſed in that of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he ſhall grow up before him as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tender plant, and as a Root out of dry ground, he hath no form nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him there is no beauty that we ſhall deſire him, he is deſpiſed and rejected of Men, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from him, and we eſteem him not, ſurely he hath born our grief, and yet we eſteemed him, ſtricken, ſmitten
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65284:83"/> of God, and afflicted, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all, he was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth, he was brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, he opened not his Mouth, he was taken from Priſon, and from Judgment, he made his Grave with the Wicked, and with the Rich in his Death, becauſe he had done no violence, neither was deceit found in his Mouth, he poured out his Soul unto death, and was numbred with the Tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. to 11. This further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſts Humiliation &amp; Abaſement for Mans Salvation, is further expreſſed by the Pſalmiſt, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? I am a worm and no man, a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the People, all men that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn, they ſhoot out the Lip, and ſhake the Head, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 22. to 18. This ſheweth in a Type, what indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, reproach and miſery, the Saviour of the World ſhould be expoſed unto, in the accompliſhing of Mans Salvation, and this was actually performed, and brought about at Chriſts Suffering, he was mocked reviled and flouted at, when apprehended and brought to the Croſs, He truſted in the Lord, let him deliver him, ſeeing he delighted in him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.27, 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.35, 43. Becauſe Chriſt ſuffered leaving us an example that we ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his ſteps, who did not ſin, neither was guile found in his Mouth, who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This myſtery of love and redemption of Man, is magnified by Chriſts unparallelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65284:84"/> and goodneſs, that he did not only abaſe himſelf unto the greateſt indignities in the fleſh, but he doth good for evil, he doth not only make an Attonement by his death for the ſins of Enemies, but he alſo exalteth them from the greateſt depth of miſery, to the higheſt form of glory, an union with himſelf, Father, Angels, and Saints, as it is more fully expreſſed elſewhere.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine and Truth of Mans Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, is not only given to us, for our everlaſting conſolation, but alſo for our inſtruction and direction, in Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Patience, and new obedience, in our ſojourning ſtate, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though eternal Life, our Redemption, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is freely given and procured by his alone merit, nevertheleſs he makes every man by a bleſſing on his Graces, given to him, inſtrumental of his own Salvation, we are commanded <hi>To work out our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling,</hi> and as the Lord waits to be gracious ſo he commands and expects to be called upon for all his Mercies which he intends to beſtow upon his People, in that famous Scripture where he makes a new Covenant, and Promiſes new and clean heart, and to pour out his Spirit, though he doth it freely, and for his own name and glory, yet he doth not intend his People ſhould be bare Spectators, and only paſſive in the receipt of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but that they ſhould be active and ſolicitous in the duties of Faith, Patience, New Obedience and Prayer, <hi>I will yet for this ſaith tbe Lord, be enquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them,</hi> and ſeeing all the days of our ſojourning here, we muſt wait until our change come, and that as our duties are ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, ſo we are obnoxious unto temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and difficulties, and for our help and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſteddily to ſteer our courſe, we cannot have a more proper mean than to ſet Chriſt before us as a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65284:84"/> Patern, who is the Captain and Author of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that in his Doctrine and Practice.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in his Doctrine, his Doctrine is Preaching up Holineſs, Patience in Sufferings, Mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, Peaceableneſs in Loſſes, Contempt of the World, Zeal for the Kingdom of God, and Faith in the Providences of God, and under all Deſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Mutual Love and Charity and Relief to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed as a Duty even to Enemies.</p>
            <p>His Doctrine is all for Holineſs, be ye Holy, as your Heavenly Father is Holy, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.48.</p>
            <p>Patience in ſufferings, Bleſſed are ye, when Men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Evil againſt you, for my ſake, rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for ſo Perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.11, 12. If ye be Reproached for the Name of Chriſt, Happy are ye, for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Glory and of God, are on you; on their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 4.14. to end.</p>
            <p>He teacheth mutual forbearance, and not to return evil, but to do good for evil, ye have heard it ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I ſay unto you, that you reſiſt not evil with evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy Right Cheek, turn to him the other alſo, if any Man ſue thee at Law, to take away thy Coat, let him have thy Cloak alſo, if a Man will compel thee to go with him a Mile, go with him two, hence we are taught the great Spirit of Meekneſs, whereof Chriſt was the Pattern, and are commanded to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our Paſſionate Reſentments of Injuries done us, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.38, 39. He Preacheth up the Duty of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Charitable ſupplying of the Indigent, give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of the turn thou not away, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.43. Remember them that are in Bonds, as being bound
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65284:85"/> with them, and them which ſuffer Adverſity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves alſo in the Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. What doth it profit if a Man ſay, he hath Faith, and hath not Works? can Faith ſave him? if a Brother or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be Naked and Deſtitute of daily Food, and one of you ſay unto him, depart in peace, be you Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and be you Filled, notwithſtanding you give him nothing <hi>James</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. of theſe things which are needful to the Body, what doth it profit? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. Mortification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thy Right Eye or Right Hand offend thee, cut it off, and caſt it from thee, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one of thy Members periſh, than thy whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould be caſt into Hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.29, 30. Hence we are taught the Subduing and Mortifying of all Luſts of whatſoever eſteem they may be, and as dear to us, as any of our Members, we are to admit no enjoyment of them, in Competition with true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and new Obedience. He Preacheth up the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Love and Charity to all Men, even to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you have heard, that it hath been ſaid, love thy Neighbour, and hate thy Enemy; but I ſay to you, Love your Enemies, Bleſs him that Curſe you; do good to them that hate you, pray for them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pightfully uſe you, and perſecute you, that ye may be the Children of your Father, which is in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and the Rain to come down on the Juſt and the Unjuſt, for if you love them that love you, what reward have you? do not even the <hi>Publicans</hi> do the ſame? and if you Salute only your Brethren, what more do ye than others? but be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.43. to end.</p>
            <p>See that great Doctrine of Mutual Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he that ſaith he is in the Light, and hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is in Darkneſs even until now, he that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light, and there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſtumbling in him, but he that Hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65284:85"/> is in Darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth, becauſe the Darkneſs hath blinded his Eyes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. to 18.</p>
            <p>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren, he that loveth not his Brother, abideth in Death, whoſoever hateth his Brother, is a Murderer, and ye know, that no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer hath Eternal Life abiding in him, hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive we the Love of God; becauſe he hath laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our Life for the Brethren, but whoſoever hath this Worlds good, and ſhutteth up his Bowels from the Brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16, 17. Let us Love one another, for Love is of God, and every one that Loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God, he that Loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love, in this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him, herein is the Love of God Manifeſted, not that we loved him, but that he Loved us, and ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our Sins, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another, if we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us, and we have known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the love that God hath to us, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1 <hi>Jo,</hi> 4.7, to end.</p>
            <p>A New Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, that you love one another, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.34. from all which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of the Nature and Extent of Charity, that it doth not conſiſt, only in naked and bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Friendſhip, good wiſhes, and pretended Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, but in the Bowels of Tenderneſs, Compaſſion, Simpathy, and ſuitable Supplies, to the neceſſities of others, that Charity is not to be ſtraitned and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65284:86"/> to Relations, Friends, Benefactors, and theſe in Amity, and perſwaſion with us, but is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Enemies, as well as Friends, and to all whoſe Neceſſities call for our help and aſſiſtance in any reſpect, towards their Relief.</p>
            <p>He Preacheth up the Contempt, and Denyedneſs to the World, lay not up Treaſure on Earth, where the Moth Cankereth, and Thieves break thorough and ſteal, but ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, then all theſe things ſhall be added thereunto, and lay up ſtore for your ſelves in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.19, 20, 32, 33. See Chriſts own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Rich Man in the Goſpel, that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for a Camel to go thorow the Eye of a Needle than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.23, 24. See the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi> who received his good things in this Life, and is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Tormented, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> who was pinched with Want, Hunger, Cold, and Diſeaſes on Earth, was received into everlaſting Happineſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 16, 19. to end.</p>
            <p>See the Parable of the Rich Husband-Man, who took anxious care for his Earthly Store, but made no Proviſion for Eternal Life, but God ſaid to him, thou Fool, this Night will I require thy Soul at thy Hands, then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be, which thou haſt provided? ſo is he who layeth up ſtore for himſelf, and is not Rich towards God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 16. to 22.</p>
            <p>See the wo the Lord of Life pronounceth againſt the Rich, <hi>Wo to you that are Rich, for ye have received your Conſolation,</hi> Luke 6, 24.</p>
            <p>And to forward our Mortification to the World, let us conſider the Advice given by the Holy Apoſtle, Love not the World, nor the things of the World, for if any Man love the World, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him, for all that is in the World, the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65284:86"/> Pride of Life is not of the Father, but of the World, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>And the World paſſeth away and the Luſts thereof, but he that doth the Will of God, abideth for ever. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. The Holy Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> doth eminently diſcover the danger of loving the World, know ye not that the Friendſhip of the World is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World is the Enemy of God, <hi>James</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Let us further conſider the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the World, we brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ſhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out, and having Food and Rayment, let us be therewith content, but they that will be Rich, fall into many Temptations, and a Snare and many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and hurtful Luſts, which drown Men in Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Perdition, for the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil, which while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through with many Sorrows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>This Bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the only Wiſdom, Light, and truth it ſelf, teacheth his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a dependance on himſelf, by Faith and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in all Providences, and as in the foregoing Scriptures, we are taught the emptineſs of all other ſupports beſides himſelf, and the emptineſs of all other Enjoyments, his purpoſe therein, is to wean our Hearts from thence, and fix them on himſelf, by Faith and Submiſſion in all Providences: he tells us, that a Mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of what a Man hath, in the foregoing Inſtance of the Rich Husband-Man, and that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God, this was the Doctrine of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when in the Wilderneſs they murmured for want of Bread, and when they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65284:87"/> were ſhut up from expectation of help, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities of ſupply, were hid from their Eyes, he minds them of the great wonders God had wrought for them, in their Deliverance from <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and deſigning to wind up their thoughts to God by Faith, that he would as well relieve them in that ſtraight, as well as he had done from under former difficulties, and therefore tell them, Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God, <hi>Deu.</hi> 8.3. Implying that the ſole pleaſure of God, influences all the Creatures, and that God in his Omnipotence and Wiſdom, is not confined to the Methods and Appearances of Men, but can in his own way, accompliſh his purpoſe at his own pleaſure, his Bleſſing on the Creature can Augment them, to ſuch a Pitch as he deſigns, he can make a little Pot of Oyl, ſwell to many Barrels, when he deſigns to manifeſt his Power, and good Will to Man, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. to 8. he can make one or two ſingle Meals, feed and refreſh for forty Days and forty Nights, he can make five Loaves and two ſmall Fiſhes, feed five thouſand Men, and cauſe the Fragments left, to exceed the firſt bulk, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.12. to 18. he can open the Windows of Heaven, and give a Bleſſing, ſo as no room is for it to be ſtowed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. he Cloaths the Lillies, and feeds the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, without their Care or Induſtry, ſo that Faith and Submiſſion to his Bleſſed Will and Care will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all things. He it is that Commands, <hi>ſeek</hi> and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye ask the Father in my Name, believe ye have it, and <hi>ye ſhall receive it, Math.</hi> 7.7. to 13.</p>
            <p>Now as Chriſts Doctrine is full and without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, ſo his Sufferings are without example, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Sin, not only againſt God, but upright alſo and perfect, ſo as he could not offend againſt Mans Law, and that all his ſufferings were voluntary,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65284:87"/> of pure love, not for Friends, but for Sinners, and Enemies, wherefore ſuch as believe in him, and have the Hope of eternal Life, ought chearfully and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure Temptations, and bear their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Fleſh, and willingly take up and bear the Croſs, and more paraicularly for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To bear the Croſs, is Chriſts Command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For this we have the Example of Chriſt his Prophets, Saints and Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We have his Manifold promiſes of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Croſs is the inevitable Path and Way, by which he leads his People to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is the means by which he fits his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Holineſs, for that eternal Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Reward of Eternal Life at the end of the Race, is exceeding great.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Patient ſuffering and bearing the Croſs is Chriſts Command: Chriſt Jeſus, the Word of God, by whom is forgiveneſs of Sins, and Redemption through his Blood, who made our Peace through the Blood of his Croſs, Preacheth this Doctrine, <hi>come unto me all ye that Labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are Heavy Laden, and I will give you reſt, take my Yoak upon you, and learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly in Mind, my Yoak is eaſy and my Burthen is Light,</hi> Math. 11.28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>When he ſends out his Diſciples to Inſtruct and Convert the World, he tells them, he ſends them as Sheep in the midſt of Woolves, he Commands them to be wiſe as Serpents, and harmleſs as Doves, and that they ſhall be brought before Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and hated of all Men for his ſake, and that they could not expect better Entertainment than he their Maſter, that they muſt deny Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65284:88"/> and all other Relations and things dear to them for his ſake, and if they loved their Lives, or any thing elſe better than him, they ſhould looſe them, and he that taketh not up his Croſs, and followeth not him, was not worthy of him, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.10. to end.</p>
            <p>This alſo hath been the ſtrain of all the Prophets and Apoſtles, to Preach up Patient bearing of the Croſs, to you it is given, ſaith the Apoſtle, not only to believe but alſo to ſuffer <hi>Phi.</hi> 1.27. to 31. let us go forth therefore, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle unto him bearing his Reproach. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12. to 16. Count it all Joy ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> when you fall into divers Temptations, knowing that the Trial of your Faith worketh Patience, but let Patience have her perfect works, that ye may be entire wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>James</hi> 1. to 6. take the Prophets, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, for an example of ſuffering, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Patience, ye have heard of the Patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pittiful, and of tender Mercy, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7. to 12. For even hereunto are we called, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an Example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye ſhould follow his Steps, who did not Sin, neither was guile found in his Mouth, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to him that Judgeth Righteouſly, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 2. to end. <hi>ch.</hi> 3, 14, 25.</p>
            <p>Whoſe own ſelf bore our ſins in his own Body on the Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, We have the Sufferings of Chriſt, and his Prophets, Apoſtles, Saints and Martyrs for our Examples, the Holy Scriptures give an account of the Opprobious uſage of Chriſt, his patient Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65284:88"/> his Ignominious death, who willingly gave up his Life for Enemies, ſee this more particularly under four heads, elſewhere.

The whole book of Holy writ, offers to our view, a large Catalogue of the ſufferings of Prophets, Saints, and Martyrs, with their patient deportment therein, how patiently did <hi>Moſes</hi> the mildeſt of Men bear the revilings of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> and prayed for <hi>Miriam,</hi> Numb. 12. ſo the Lord healed her? How humble was <hi>David</hi> under his Son <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Uſurpation of his Crown, and defiling his Wives in the ſight of the Sun, when he and all the People went out of the City bare-foot, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and aſhes on their heads, when they fled from <hi>Abſolom?</hi> If I ſhall find favour in his ſight, ſaith he, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it (meaning the Ark of God in which he much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted) and his Habitation, but if he ſay I have no delight in thee, lo here am I, let him do with me what ſeemeth good in his ſight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. With the like humility and patience, he bore the curſings and revilings of <hi>Shimei,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, let him curſe, becauſe the Lord hath ſaid, Curſe <hi>David,</hi> who then ſhall ſay why haſt thou done it? it may be the Lord will look upon mine afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the Lord will require me good for his curſing this day, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, to 13.</p>
            <p>How humbly did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lay himſelf, and <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecahs</hi> Railing and Blaſpheming Letter before the Lord, at the Siege of <hi>Samaria?</hi> and ſee the event thereof by Gods wonderful delivering of the City by his own immediate hand, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.

            <p>How reſolutely did the three Children with Faith and Patience, ſubmit to the fiery Furnace for the honour of God, and his Truth? <hi>Our God is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us out of thy hand, but if not, be is known unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Holy <hi>Stephen</hi> couragiouſly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endured Martyrdom, and kneeling down prayed for his Enemies, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they are doing,</hi> Act. 7.60.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtles were made ſpectacles of Men and Angels, <hi>God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as ſpectacles of Men and Angels, and to the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.9. The Croſs of Chriſt was the glory of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſhould be of all Men, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p>See the inſtances of the Apoſtles ſufferings, we are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed, we are perplexed, but not to deſpair, perſecuted, but not forſaken, caſt down, but not deſtroyed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the life alſo of Jeſus, might be made manifeſt in our body, for we which live are always delivered to death for Jeſus ſake, that the Life of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mortal fleſh. 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.8, 9 10, 11.</p>
            <p>See a farther inſtance of the Apoſtles ſuffering, but in all things approving our ſelves as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65284:89"/> in diſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments, in tumults, in labour, in watching, in faſtings, in pureneſs of knowledge, by long ſufferings, by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeigned, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſhonour, by evil report and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as deceivers and yet true, as unknown yet well known, as dying and yet behold we live, as chaſtned and yet not killed, as ſorrowful yet always rejoying, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet poſſeſſing all things, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 6.4, to 11.</p>
            <p>Of the Jews, five times received I forty ſtripes, ſave one, thrice was I beaten with Rods, once was I ſtoned, thrice I ſuffered Shipwrack, a Night and a Day I have been in the Deep, in peril by Water, in perils by Robbers, in peril by mine own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, in perils by the Heathen, in perils in the City, in perils in the Country, in danger in the Sea, in perils by falſe Brethren, often in wearineſs, painfulneſs and watching, often in hunger and thirſt, often in cold and nakedneſs, 2 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 11.24. to 28.</p>
            <p>See the Inſtances of the Churches ſufferings and great afflictions, almoſt incredible, and by Nature without Grace intollerable, her ſore runs in the night, her friends not only left her, but dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly with her, and became her Enemies, the Enemy ſpread his hand on all her pleaſant things, her people have given their pleaſant things for Bread, no ſore like my ſore, deſolate and faint, delivered into their hands from whom ſhe was not able to riſe, ſhe was trodden as in a Wine preſs, Prieſts and Elders gave up the Ghoſt for Famine, Children and Sucklings ſwoun away in the Street, and Women eat their Children of a Span long, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hiſs and wag their Head, and ſay we have ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her up, this is the day we looked for, and yet in all this, ſhe can with patience and ſubmiſſion

And thus juſtifieth the Lord and applieth to him by Prayer and Confeſſion of Sin for Mercy, the Holy Apoſtles alſo rejoyce in their afflictions, that they are counted worthy to ſuffer for the teſtimony of Jeſus, and ſay, in all this through Grace, <hi>We are more than Conquerours, and God forbid that we ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Promiſes of aſſiſtance: as the greateſt evils are alleviate, and greateſt extremities are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, by hope, and help of means and relief, and as the moſt diſeaſed perſons, in the moſt chronical and malignant Diſtempers, are eaſed, compoſed, and half cured, by the ſight of a famous and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſitian, and by his aſſurance or opinion that the Diſtemper they labour under is curable, or that the Diſtemper which he can eaſily cure, will not only work it ſelf out, but will alſo cure and cleanſe the body, of more groſs and contagious humours, which are more dangerous and infectious of the blood, as Agues often cure Hectique and malignant Feavers, which more invade and annoy the brain and endanger the Life; ſo the bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, being the great Shepherd and Phyſitian of Souls, in whom the Godhead dwelleth bodily, not only knoweth as being omniſcient, but alſo has all power both in Heaven and Earth given to him: hath not only the means in his own hand, but by his Promiſes hath engaged himſelf, by his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he will heal, help, and deliver his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore faith in the Promiſes of God, doth and ſhould uphold his afflicted and diſcouraged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and theſe Promiſes are ſure, numerous, and by Divine Wiſdom and Love, ſuited and proportioned to the exigence of his People in all caſes, either in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65284:90"/> Spiritual or Temporal maladies; and theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes anſwer to the twofold eſtate or condition of Man, as he is either under Spiritual or Temporal Diſeaſes or Temptations.</p>
            <p>And firſt a Spiritual, and as the Soul is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Body, ſo the diſeaſes of the Soul are more dangerous, grievous and uneaſy, <hi>The Spirit of a Man can bear his Infirmities, but a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> as all the motions of the body are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered by the diſtemper of the Spirit, ſo greateſt care ſhould be taken to cure and remove the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof, and this is the great conſolation of the diſeaſed in Spirit, that their Phyſitian hath cures paramount to the cures of all others, as being in himſelf omnipotent, to whom alone is given the faculty of healing of Soul diſtempers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, and to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in</hi> Zion, <hi>to give unto them Beauty for Aſhes, the oil of Joy for Mourning, the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs, that they might be called Trees of Righteouſneſs, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified,</hi> Iſa. 61.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>And ſee hence what great encouragement the Saints have to wait on God, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Promiſes, who is faithful and cannot fail; the Church and People of God, ſay in the ſame Scripture, <hi>I will rejoyce in the Lord, my Soul ſhall be joyful in my God, for he hath cloathed me with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Salvation, he hath covered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e with the Robe of Righteouſneſs, as a Bridegroom decketh himſelf with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65284:91"/> Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her ſelf with her Jewels,</hi> Iſa. 61.10.</p>
            <p>By which we ſee his Promiſes are not only large, but he makes them effectual in the Chriſtians Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereof to their own comfort: theſe Promiſes may be branched forth anſwerable to the ſeveral Spiritual Diſtempers in theſe three Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Under Spiritual darkneſs and deſertion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Under anguiſh of Spirit for heinous Sins.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the multitude of Sins or under Relapſes.</p>
            <p>And as to theſe three ſtates or conditions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diſtempers, ſee the manifold particular and appoſite Promiſes of God under theſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Diſeaſe to which Gods Promiſes are annexed, is under Temporary afflictions and trials, which though he could eaſie and inſtantly remove, nevertheleſs as a wiſe and juſt Phyſitian, judiciouſly conſults the Patients Diſtemper, and finds that one ſingle Doſe or Potion is not enough, but that a courſe of Phyſick is abſolutely neceſſary to cure the Diſtemper, and as he ſtudies neither to gratify the Patients preſent diſtempered Palat, nor his uneaſy humour, but minds the moſt ſuitable Medicines, proper method of Cure, order of Diet and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe under the Cure, he confines him to retirement and abſtinence, as well from the luxuriant eating and drinking, and the too great liberty of former converſe, as the cauſes and riſe of his diſtemper, ſo that tender Phyſitian of Souls the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, takes the ſame method of curing and relieving his afflicted under their diſtempers by afflictions, and as he knows the humours, on which the Phyſick is to work, that it muſt have liberty and time for operation, and that the Patient muſt needs be ſick
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65284:91"/> and anxious for a Cordial; as when a Chirurgeon hath bound up a wound and applied ſuitable Plaiſters pinching and cauthorizing, which neceſſarily in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to cure muſt annoy, and diſquiet the patient, that he will importune the Doctor for a Cordial, to abate his ſickneſs, and the Chirurgeon to remove the Plaiſter; nevertheleſs they wiſely conſidering, that giving a Cordial, or removing the Plaiſters before its time, hinders cure, encreaſeth more and groſſer humours, therefore gives no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, but advice of Patience, and aſſurance of cure, on the due operation of the means; ſo this great Phyſitian of Souls, though <hi>in all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he is afflicted,</hi> he will take his own time and way for their relief, and affords no other Cordial for the preſent, but that of his univerſal promiſes, which are extenſive to all circumſtances of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes and conditions, which may be branched out in theſe heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sickneſs. Secondly, Impriſonments. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Poverty. Fourthly, Deſertion, and forſaking of friends. Fifthly, Under Slanders and Reproaches, in all which caſes the Lords promiſes are not only full and numerous, but alſo peculiarly appoſite, and eſpecially calculated by him to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd every of the particular caſes, which is more expreſly ſet down before.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fourth encouragement for the People of God to bear afflictions patiently, is that the Croſs of Chriſt is the Path way, that Chriſt hath appointed his People to walk to Heaven, for if you be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, then are you Baſtards and no Sons, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, to 12. Wo is me for my hurt, my wound is grievous, but I ſaid I muſt bear it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.19, 24. O Lord correct me not in thine anger but in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaſt thou bring me to nothing, I am with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65284:92"/> thee ſaith the Lord to ſave thee, though I make a full end of all Nations whether I have ſcattered thee, I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in meaſure, and not leave thee altogether unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11.</p>
            <p>And this is Chriſts Legacy to his followers, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall deliver up Brothers to death, the Fathers ſhall riſe againſt the Children, and Children againſt their Parents, and cauſe them to be put to Death, and ye ſhall be hated of all men for my ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.6. to 40. and if any man will be my Diſciple he muſt deny himſelf, lay down his Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take up his Croſs daily, and follow me, if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf, for the time is come, that Judgment muſt begin at the Houſe of God, and if it firſt begin at us what ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel of God? if the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly appear? wherefore let them that ſuffer according to the Will of God, commit the keeping of their Souls to him in well doing, as unto a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17, 18. For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpair not thee: behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God, to them that fell ſeverity, but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs; otherwiſe thou ſhalt be cut off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21, 22.</p>
            <p>Is it not the foretold Lot of Gods People, that through tribulation and perſecution they muſt enter into the Kingdom of God? and the Diſciple cannot expect better entertainment than the maſter, if they have called the Maſter <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> how much more they of his houſe-hold? <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.24, 25.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The furnace of affliction is the means, by which the wiſe contriver of our Salvation, fits his People for theſe eternal Manſions of Glory, for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65284:92"/> as the Goldſmith doth purify his mettal by fire and furnace, to bring it to the pure and true touch, and as the Joiner by Plain and Chiſſel faſhioneth his Wood, for his Mortice, even ſo the Lord who is of purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity, by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly chaſtiſements, of trials and afflictions, doth poliſh and fit his peoples Hearts and Affections, and by blaſting the glory of humane enjoyments, he raiſeth their deſires to the heavenly enjoyments, and fits and faſhions them with ſuitable qualifications of holineſs, and having experienced the vanity, emptineſs, and uncertainty of all earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their affections are wholly raiſed unto, and ſet upon God alone. The Prodigal had never thought of the plenty, wealth, or glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe, or of returning thither, had it not been that he was pinched and under ſtraits. The Church had not thought of returning to her firſt love, had it not been, that her Corn and Wine, and the delicacies by which ſhe entertained her ſelf with, and lived voluptuouſly, were taken away, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>The ſixth thing to encourage Believers patiently to bear the Croſs, is the great prize of Eternal Life already ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected, that the Doctrine of mortification, ſelf-denial, and contempt of the World, is a comfortleſs, and melancholy Doctrine, and Heaven ſeems only to be obtained on hard and dear terms, and that the neceſſity of looſing all for Heaven, will encourage the neglect of Heaven, and induce men rather to take <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, in taking pleaſure and delight in the Creatures, and therein to comfort themſelves, and thereby they will be the leſs anxious for Heaven, <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 11.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Doctrine ſeems contrary to the Scriptures, which promiſes halcyon days to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65284:93"/> Church, and great Honour, Wealth, and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that Kings ſhall be her nurſing Fathers, and Queens her nurſing Mothers, and that the Saints ſhall Judge the Earth, how then can this conſiſt with the contempt of the World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine ſeems deſparagable, and contrary to the Holy, Juſt, and good Nature of God, to treat the beſt of his Friends and People with pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Difficulties and Contempt, and to ſuffer the wicked to enjoy their full delight, and amongſt Men, it will be thought great ingratitude, to treat the beſt of Friends, worſe than the worſt of Enemies.</p>
            <p>As it is moſt certain from experience, and Hiſtory from the beginning of the World, and coming of Chriſt, the People of God have been under the worſt of Temporary Circumſtances, ſo it is likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the foregoing Diſcourſe, that this is their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Lot, and this hath alſo been the ſtumbling of the Saints, and particularly to <hi>David,</hi> the wicked's conſtant oppulency, quiet, and proſperity, made him much amazed, <hi>Pſalms</hi> 10. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 17.9. to 15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 37. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.3. to 17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1.</p>
            <p>See what Holy <hi>Job</hi> the Patient, and Wiſe, ſaith on this Subject, <hi>The Wicked become Old, they are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Power, their Seed is Eſtabliſhed in their Sight, and Of-ſpring in their Eyes, their Houſes are ſafe from fear, the wrath of God is not upon them, their Bull gendreth and faileth not, their Cow Calveth, and caſteth not her Calf, they ſend forth their little ones like a Flock, and their Children dance, they take the Timbrel and Harp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the ſound of the Organ, they ſpend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to their Grave, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay unto God, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy war, what is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him, and what profit have we, if we Pray unto him?</hi> Job 21.7. to 16.</p>
            <p>And the ſame Language was in uſe in the time of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65284:93"/> the Prophet <hi>Malachy. And ye ſaid it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit have we, if we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ordinances, and that we have walked mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before the Lord of Hoſts? and now we call the proud Happy, and they that work wickedneſs, are ſet up, yea, even they that tempt God, are delivered,</hi> Mal. 3.14.</p>
            <p>For the full clearing and anſwering theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us conſider the things in Competition and Weigh them in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and theſe are chiefly two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Enjoyments of this ſenſual Life and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are Temporary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Things Spiritual, which are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As God of his Heavenly Wiſdom, made the World for his own glory, and by himſelf upholds the ſame, and gives to whom he pleaſeth, what por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof he will, ſo it is at his pleaſure to recall what he giveth when he will, ſo that Man is but a Sojourner in Earth, and Tenant at Will, for Life, and all Human Enjoyments, and Mans claim thereunto is extinguiſhable at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us conſider the vaſt diſproportion in value, between things Temporal, and things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rital: <hi>Solomon</hi> the Wiſeſt, and of greateſt experience hath given us this Teſtimony on Record, that all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Enjoyments, are but vanity and vexation of Spirit, <hi>Ecl.</hi> 2. all. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the foregoing Scriptures, ſheweth the emptineſs and vanity of all, that may be challenged for good or great in the World, that all periſh in the uſing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. to 17.</p>
            <p>The Holy Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> gives us the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. ſo that the whole that can be pretended to in this World, is ſome preſent poſſeſſion of Worlds vanities, attended with unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and diſcontent of Mind, uncertainty in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65284:94"/> Enjoyment, all being ſubject to change, at the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us conſider the Nature, Value, and Continuance of things Spiritual; things Spiritual litterally underſtood, imply ſomething above the ſenſual Appetite and Perception, and only to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and enjoyed by the Spirit, Mind, or Soul of Man, the Nobler part, and that is Eternal and not ſeen, as deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <hi>while we look not after things which are ſeen, but after things which are not ſeen; for that which is ſeen is Temporal, but that which is not ſeen, is Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.18.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are to conſider, what are theſe Spiritual things which Tranſcend, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſenſual Enjoyments, about which the Soul is only and principally exerciſed, which may be briefly comprized in theſe four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God and Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All Spiritual Endowments and Graces given to the Saints, and procured to them by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Sanctified Uſe of all Temporal and Spiritual Mercies beſtowed on the Saints, while in time.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Eternal Life obtained, and freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Saints by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt; God of his own free Will, having Created Man in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. Scripture and ſad experience inform us, that our firſt Parents, and we in them, have fallen from the Original State of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, in which they were Created, and thereby the Venom of their ſin. hath infected and depraved Mans Nature at ſuch a rate, that there being a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for an Atonement, and ſatisfaction to Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for Mans Sin; And of a Mediator between God
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65284:94"/> and Man, to reſtore Man to the pure and unſpotted Image of God, and it being impoſſible for Men or Angels, to make ſuch Atonement, or to procure a Mediator; The free Love of God, raiſeth one up even Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, and expreſs Image of his Father, to take upon him the ſhape of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and though he knew no ſin, to become ſin for us; ſo that by taking upon him our Nature, and in our ſhape and place ſubmitting to the Juſtice of God on the Croſs, hath paid the Ranſom for us, and reſtored fallen man to the Image of God, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and True Holineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21, 22, 47, 48.</p>
            <p>The firſt Man is of the Earth, Earthy; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Man is the Lord from Heaven; and as is the Earthy, ſo are they which are Earthy, and as is the Heavenly, ſo are they which are Heavenly, and as we have born the Image of the Earthy, we alſo ſhall bear the Image of the Heavenly; and thus Chriſt having paid the Ranſom for Sinners, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to all Men the free Market of Salvation, Pardon and Eternal Life; for God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, ſhould not Periſh, but have Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. For when we were without ſtrength, Chriſt dyed for us; when we were yet Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But it may be Objected that Chriſt had a Body, and Mans Nature, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, ſeems things under the Comprehenſion of Senſe and Feeling.</p>
            <p>Anſwer; Although Chriſt had, and took on him Mans Nature, nevertheleſs the Myſtery of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Communication of Garces and Eternal Life, procured by him, muſt be apprehended by Faith, and can never be reached by Human Senſe; the Natural Man knoweth not the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65284:95"/> things of God, neither indeed can do, becauſe they are ſpiritually Diſcerned.</p>
            <p>The Second thing in the Treaſury of Spiritual Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are the various gifts and graces ſpiritually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by God, to believers in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo, freely give us all things? Ro.</hi> 8.32. Theſe choice and ſpiritual Mercies may be claſſed up in theſe three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such as are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the actual laying hold on Jeſus Chriſt, and applying him in his Merits, Sufferings, Reſurrection and Glorification, as the only Mediator between God and Man, ſuch is Faith, <hi>for without Faith, it is impoſſihle to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
            <p>Faith is that Grace whereby Chriſt is owned, and upon which Salvation is promiſed, in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture, This is that grace that unites and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates Sinners to God, <hi>for ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> this is that grace which gives Life, Sap, and being to Chriſtians, <hi>Now the Juſt ſhall live by Faith, but if any Man draw back, my Soul hath no Delight in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. This is the only operative and effectual grace, <hi>where is boaſting then? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is excluded, by what Law? by Works? Nay, by the Law of Faitb, therefore we conclude, that Man is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.23.</p>
            <p>Although this of Faith be the chief eſſential grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on which the being of a Chriſtian depends, this flows from the ſpirit of God, <hi>from whom are all good and perfect gifts,</hi> and by him are wrought in us, <hi>for by grace are ye ſaved, through Faith, and not of your ſelves, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſecond grace is Holineſs, without which alſo it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>be ye Holy, as your Heavenly Father is Holy, who is of purer Eyes, than can
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65284:95"/> behold Iniquity,</hi> this grace qualifieth Sinners to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God in Purity, Innocence, and Righteouſneſs, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Spirit, for they ſhall ſee God, Math·</hi> 5.8. and thus it behoveth Chriſtia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s to be, for that Chriſt having taken on him our Nature, to purifie it from all the ſtains of ſin, he makes all his Children partakers of the Divine Nature and deſigning to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble them in the New <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> where no unclean thing can enter, they muſt all be Holy, and Clothed with Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>This eſſential Duty is Recommended and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to us in Scriptures, <hi>we are all his Workmanſhip Created in Chriſt to good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them, and are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation of the Apoſtles, and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner Stone, in whom all the Building fitly Framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord,</hi> Eph. 2.8, 9, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>And that ye put off concerning the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the Old Man which is Corrupt, according to the Deceitful Luſts, and that you put on the new <hi>Man, Created according to Holineſs, Eph.</hi> 4.21. to end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek theſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, ſet your Affections on things above, not on things on Earth, for ye are Dead, and your Life is hid with Chriſt in God, when Chriſt who is your Life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory. Mortifie therefore your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are on Earth; and put on the New Man, which is renewed in knowledge, aften the Image of him who Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated it.</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit, to be Carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded, is Life and Peace, becauſe the Carnal Man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65284:96"/> is emnity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; ſo theſe that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God, and if Chriſt be in you, the Body is Dead becauſe of Sin, but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs; for if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye, but if through the Spirit, ye mortifie the Deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live; for as many as are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.5, 7, 10, 13, 14. <hi>and every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3.</p>
            <p>The third Special grace, coming from this great Magazine of Heavenly Store, is Mortification, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is ſuch affinity and connexion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſpiritual graces, that they are not perfect nor compleat, but when in one Chain, and joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet this grace hath ſome thing peculiar in it, as being that ſpecial piece of Accompliſhment, which frames the Soul to an immediate cloſing with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Mortification is either the curbing or ſubduing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous excreſcences, or growth of ſuperfluous Humours in the Body, or like proud fleſh about a wound under Cure or the total deſtroying of that which hath the Preheminence, and may deſtroy a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life, as the reigning prevalent Luſts of the fleſh, to the Deſtruction of the Soul; in both which Senſes ſpiritual Mortification may be taken; for as the Vine and other Fruit-Trees, are oppreſſed by ſuperfluous Wood, ſo as the Sap is exhauſted in feeding ſo many ſuperfluous Bows, which may bring forth Leaves, weak Bloſſoms, but little, or at beſt bad Fruit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſufficiently Nouriſhed with Moiſture from the Root, but the Root being Disburthened from theſe excreſcences or ſuperfluous Boughs, the Root is able to communicate moiſture to the remaining part, and the Tree produceth more and better Fruit; even ſo when the affections and delight of the Soul,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65284:96"/> are ſpent upon the Luſts, and ſenſual Pleaſures of the Fleſh, the Soul and Spiritual graces are ſtarved; and whether for want of ſuitab e Encouragement, and therefore the Great and Wiſe Husband-Man, and Shepherd of the Soul, by his Chaſtiſements, lops of the ſuperfluous delights, and Luſts of the Carnal Heart, either by blaſting the Objects of our Luſts and Carnal Delights, or aſſiſts his People in this great Duty, to mortifie and wean their Affections from theſe Objects, and be more fruitful to Eternal Life, by fixing their Hearts on Chriſt Jeſus. Now as all Chriſtians are Members of Chriſt, and muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in him, <hi>John</hi> 15.1. they muſt be ſuited for that Ingraftment; and as the Joyner frames his wood, each piece to anſwer to another, and cuts it till it fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the skilful Chyrurgeon by his powder, or Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cuts off the proud Fleſh about the wound, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be clean; and as the Gardner frames the Scyon for the ſtock, even ſo muſt the Soul be ordered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be ingrafted into that ſpiritual Root, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>In this Spiritual Operation, theſe three things are conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Wherein it conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The neceſſity of the Cure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The means whereby this Cure is wrought.</p>
            <p>As it muſt be agreed unto, that all Chriſtians muſt be renewed, Rooted and built in Chriſt Jeſus, being the chief corner Stone, <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>In this is firſt the cutting off what is ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The grafting the Soul into the New Root, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it is the Cuſtom of skilful Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, in cutting any Ulcer or Ulcerated Member, to make a full enquiry into the habit, and diſpoſition
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65284:97"/> of the Patients Body, and Symptoms of the Grievance, and ſome times in his Operation purgeth, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times he Miniſters Cordials, to prevent faintings, and often times he renders the Patient inſenſible of the pain by ſleep, or otherwiſe; and before he begins his Cure, the better to be informed where the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy lyeth, if it be a Stone, he uſeth ſome Inſtrument to ſearch it; if a Wound he cleanſeth about the Wound, and when he hath made theſe Preparations, he makes Inciſion without regard of the Patients complaining of pain, until he hath finiſhed his Work; ſo in this Work of Mortification, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an muſt do theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He muſt make a full and impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He muſt prepare the Soul for the Cure, he muſt proceed and go on with the Work without partiality, or Indulgence to any ſin.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Examination in which the Thoughts and the Objects thereof on which they are moſt exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and wherein they moſt delight, are to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into, for as the thoughts and affections are ſo is the whole Man, therefore he muſt bring them to the line, and to the plummet of Gods Law, to the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if ye walk not according to this Rule, it is becauſe there is no light in you, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p>To be Carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded, is Life and Peace, and they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit, do mind the things of the ſpirit, for that the fleſh is Enmity againſt God, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.5, 6.7, 8. So that here by the Word of God, we are to examine and judge, and in the Work of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to take ſpecial care to get the thoughts, and affections, which are Carnal and Enmity againſt God by Nature, to be weaned from the Carnal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and placed on Chriſt, and the felicities in him,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65284:97"/> for ye are dead, and your Life is hid with Chriſt in God, provide your ſelves bags with wax not old, a Treaſure in Heaven which faileth not for where your Treaſures are, there will your Hearts be alſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.31, to 35. So the Chriſtian being dead to this World, and his Life hid with Chriſt in God, like the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom I am Crucified to the World, and the World to me, nevertheleſs, I live, but not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me, and the life that I live in the fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. his delight was in Heaven, and not in the ſplendor or vanities of this Life; ſo that the chief part of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, is to wean the affections from Carnal things, and to raiſe, elevate, and place them on things above, and as the thoughts and affections are to be looked unto, even ſo are all the words and actions of a Man, and if for every idle word and enormous action, we muſt anſwer, how much more are we concerned to ſearch into, and Mortifie the Corrupt Fountains from whence flow ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſour Grapes?</p>
            <p>This Examination muſt be very thorough, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, into every word, and every action, with all the lightning Circumſtances and Aggravations thereof.</p>
            <p>This Examination alſo muſt be attended with a Godly ſorrow, and a hearty Repentance, like that Repentance not to be repented of; for godly ſorrow worketh Repentance to Salvation, not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, but the ſorrow of the World worketh death, and our Repentance ſhould be ſuch as the Apoſtle Deſcribes, behold the ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrow after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what Revenge? and this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65284:98"/> is true Mortification, never to think of old Sins and Corruptions, but with Indignation and Abhorrence, as is more fully explained under the particular Head of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A ſecond thing conſiderable in the work, is a due preparation; this being no eaſie task, no leſs difficult, than the divorcing Old Friends, Lovers, and Acquaintances, and the breaking of Old inured Friendſhip; therefore the Soul muſt have this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative; he muſt be under the Conviction of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, either of periſhing eternally, or be ſeparate from the Luſts of the fleſh. If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature, Old things are done away. I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husband-Man; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. Now under this Conviction, of the neceſſity of having Old Superfluous Luſts, and Carnal deſires to be cut off and purged away, or the Soul everlaſtingly to periſh how ſhould not the Soul be wiſe, and condeſcend to the Divorce, and ſay, what have I any more to do with Idols? doth not the great Phyſitian of Souls tell us, it is better that one Member periſh, though never ſo dear, or deſirable to the fleſh, than that the whole Body and Soul ſhould be caſt into Hell, which will follow inevitably, if not divorced from Luſt, and be renewed in Chriſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20, 30.</p>
            <p>A Second preparation is, to conſider the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will accrew by this Divorce of Luſts; ſuch who are thus Divorced, ſhall be made Sons and Heirs of God with Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 23. and ſhall have all things <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. When lopt off from the World, they ſhall be united unto God in Chriſt Jeſus, their ſhort ſufferings, and parting with the Luſts of the World, ſhall work for them an exceeding and an eternal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65284:98"/>
            <p>They ſhall have treaſure in Heaven inſtead of, and in exchange of Earthly Riches.</p>
            <p>Their Life ſhall be ſaved in loſing of it, and loſt in ſaving of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9 23, 24, 25. Who then would not part with uncertain Riches for Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, with a rotten Member for a ſound Body, a paltry pleaſure for Eternal happineſs?</p>
            <p>Thus the Patient being prepared, of the neceſſity of an Inciſion to preſerve Life, and with Cordials of promiſes to prevent faintings, he muſt go on couragiouſly, to cut off all corrupt and feſtered members, of what quality or whatſoever uſe; and for this we have Chriſts expreſs command, <hi>if thy right Eye or thy right Hand offend thee cut it off,</hi> If Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, or any of the deareſt Relations come in competition, all muſt be forſaken for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23, 24, 25, 26. Thy life muſt not be preferred to him, but a man muſt take up his Croſs and follow Chriſt; ſo that nothing however ſo choice or dear to us, muſt ſtand in the way againſt, or in ballance with Chriſt, but in all theſe things a man muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf and loſe all for Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature, old things are done away and all things are made new; mortify therefore your members which are on Earth,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>The fourth Spiritual advantage from Heavenly bounty is Regeneration. It is not enough to cut off old withered branches, or lop Trees; to make them fruitful, and propagate new Trees, but plaſhing, ingrafting, or inoculation is neceſſary, even ſo in the Chriſtian Musbandry, though cutting off the old luxuriant branches of Luſt, be abſolutely neceſſary by mortification, yet this is not all, for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian muſt have a new life, for that by the impurity of Sin, and Concupiſcence of our Natures ſince the Fall, the whole Maſs of Blood or Nature is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65284:99"/> And God ſaw that the wickedneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was evil continually, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. Therefore he muſt be ingrafted into Chriſt, the true and living Vine, I am crucified to the World, and the World to me, nevertheleſs I live, but not I but Chriſt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the Fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. That ye put off concerning their former converſation, which is corrupt according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Luſts, and that ye be renewed in the Spirit of your minds, and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in true holineſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24. And be not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this World, but be ye transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of your minds, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. Know ye not that Chriſt is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be reprobates, now we are no more ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers nor forreigners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but fellow Citizens with the Saints and with the houſhold of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are built upon the foundations of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus being the chief Corner Stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an holy Temple in the Lord, in whom ye alſo are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19, to end. All which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach us, that the Chriſtian is a new man, hath a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is built on Chriſt the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nouriſher of his Life, and that Chriſt is the Vine wherein the barren Branches muſt be cut off, and the fruitful nouriſhed. This holy Lord Jeſus Chriſt convinceth the great lawyer <hi>Nichodemus</hi> of the neceſſity of Regeneration, of being born again by the Spirit, <hi>Unleſs a Man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3, 5. Now in this great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65284:99"/> concern we are to conſider two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To make a right diſcovery of the truth of this new Life by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are to conſider ſeriouſly of the means how this Conqueſt and new Life may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As this is the greateſt concern to man, to be well founded in his claim to Heaven, ſo it is eaſy to the fleſh to be deceived in this thing, for as it often falls out among Women that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by falſe conceptions, and travel long in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Birth, when both they themſelves and others are in hopes, yet it proves at laſt a deceit, oftentimes to the deſtruction of the perſon, having nouriſhed Diſeaſes and Corruptions inſtead of a true Birth, ſo no doubt many may ſeem to be under conception of this Heavenly Birth, have ſome ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and appear to labour under pain, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of the old corruption, and bring forth the Spiritual Birth, and yet Chriſt is not formed in them. As the deſire of iſſue makes many Women uſe many uneaſy and expenſive means, ſo many men for the lucre of Heaven ſtrain far and yet come ſhort, becauſe their Hearts are not ſtraight with God, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered a large ſum for the Holy Ghoſt, the young rich Man in the Goſpel kept all the Commandments, <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſold their poſſeſſions, and brought the Money to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed amongſt the Saints, and yet all fell ſhort of this new Birth, and ſo of the Kingdom of God: we are commanded to try the Spirits, for every Spirit is not of God, wherefore, that we may find out the truth and reality of this new birth; It is fit to reflect on the actions of the former Life, and examine the new life in all its parts, and find out whether the ſuitable effects of the change and new birth be produced, for according to the effects of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65284:100"/> life ſo muſt we judge of the Life, whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed or not, for the Tree is known by its fruits The effects of life are chiefly three.</p>
            <p>Firſt The Thoughts earlieſt in the conception of the rational creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Affections.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Actions.</p>
            <p>Theſe three generally make up the whole Man, and as we find theſe three concurring in the firſt degeneracy, <hi>The Thoughts of man were evil and only evil continually.</hi> So we find Thoughts, Affections, and Actions, concurring in that firſt tranſgreſſion, the rebellious Thoughts, mutining againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the luſtful affections after the fruit that was good to eat, and pleaſant to the Eyes, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one wiſe, and the actions in eating thereof. Now as by this degeneracy in our firſt Parents, the whole Nature of Man in <hi>Adams</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy was corrupted, that thenceforth their thoughts were evil and only evil continually.</p>
            <p>So that whatſoever mans eſtate was at his Fall, he muſt now have a new life by Jeſus Chriſt, and as his Nature and whole Man was corrupted, ſo muſt he be wholly framed a new, by being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into that holy frame, after the Spirit and Image of him that created him, and that in all his thoughts, affections and actions, and whether it be ſo or not, let every man ſearch and try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and</p>
            <p>Firſt, In his Thoughts, <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature in his Thoughts, let the ſame mind be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and a right regulation of a mans thoughts conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In placing of them on proper objects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In the right Government of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to theſe objects.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65284:100"/>
            <p>Man in his degeneracy and ſtate of Nature, is as in a Feaver, the whole Maſs of Blood being ſo diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and infected, that nothing is regular with him, much leſs his Thoughts, for that he is of the Earth, Earthly, and in that natural darkneſs, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth or can underſtand the things of God, like the blind Mole, always working and walking about the Earth and Earthly things, and in his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affection to the Creatures, is hurried with frantick raptures after them, and finding in them no ſatisfaction flys from one vanity to another, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove can find no reſt, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith finds all vanity and vexation of Spirit, ſo as he hated all his labour, the Wicked Man <hi>is unſtable in all his ways,</hi> but theſe renewed are made partakers of the Divine Nature, and place their deſires on Heavenly objects, have the ſame mind in them that was in Chriſt Jeſus, as Chriſt came into the World to do the Will of his Father, in the Redemption of Man, and did behave himſelf as his Kingdom not being of this World, even ſo Chriſtians are in this World as Sojourners, and muſt not look on the things of this Life, as the objects of their delight or objects of their inheritance, and therefore muſt be Spiritually minded, <hi>For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace,</hi> Rom. 8.6. Now the objects of the Spiritual Man muſt be Spiritual, and nothing can with ſatisfaction or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, contemplate any thing, but what it hath a reſemblance unto, or affinity with it, ſo that if the Thoughts be Spiritual, they will be fixed on Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Spiritual objects, which are only two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, One God in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The benefits accrewing to man from thence.</p>
            <p>Firſt, On God as that only eſſential and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65284:101"/> Being by whom the World was made, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in his Infinite Power, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p>In his holineſs, of <hi>purer Eyes than can behold Iniquity.</hi> In his Juſtice to reward the upright and condemn the guilty.</p>
            <p>In his Wiſdom, As Wiſdom it ſelf, and who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Wiſdom to all Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>In his Love, He is love and dwelleth in love, <hi>God ſo loved the World that he ſent his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh but have Eternal Life,</hi> John 3.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>In his Mercy, Witneſs his long forbearance and forgiveneſs of Sins through Chriſt Jeſus, with the merciful thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf merciful, and with the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18.25, 26. and ſo through all the Attributes of God, where there is an Ocean of Delight to pitch upon, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up and drown all the moſt longing deſires, and fill the greateſt appetite, on which are ſpent the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal breathings and delight of the Angels and Saints in Heaven. Therefore ſhall they be before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, <hi>Rev.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, On Chriſt that Ocean of Conſolation to Believers, who ſhall have from him fulneſs of Joy and Pleaſures for evermore; who humbled himſelf to death to ſee them on the Throne of Glory, who was made Sin though he knew no Sin, that Sin might not be imputed to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. Who brought them from being ſlaves of Sin to the Inheritance of Sonſhip and Glory with himſelf and made them heirs of all things, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. who is made to Saints <hi>Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> and all and in all to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13.</p>

            <p>Secondly, The ſecond object on which the thoughts of the renewed Chriſtians are to be exerciſed, are the things of great advantage which flow to them from the bounty of God in Chriſt Jeſus, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that inexpreſſible dignity, honour, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being made partakers of the Divine Nature, and being made one, with the Father and the Son in mind, will, and glory, and to be where God is for ever, in that often repeated place, <hi>John</hi> 17. They ſhall feed on the Tree of Life, in the Paradiſe of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7.17. have the white Stone, and in it a new name, and have power over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12, 21. they ſhall ſit. <hi>On the Throne of Glory before God, and ſhall ſerve him day and night, ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, or any heat, and God ſhall lead them unto living fountains of Water, and wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and there ſhall be no more ſorrow,</hi> Rev. 7.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>The thoughts of Believers being thus directed to their proper objects, as they are yet in the Valley of Tears, and obnoxious to the temptations of the Fleſh, and ſubject to ſo many incident diſtractions, their thoughts are frequently diverted from their proper courſe; the means thereof to fix them right, when any temptation occurs, whether from the Luſt of the Eyes, Luſts of the Fleſh, or Pride of Life, is to compare the object offered, with that on which the Thoughts ſhould center, and bringing infinite beauty, glory, and power, that which is infinitely full of all perfection, and above what eye can ſee, or ear hear, or heart apprehend; how
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65284:102"/> eaſily may this parrallel eclipſe, dazzle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the inſinuations of Fleſhly Luſts, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the uſing?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond part of the renewed man is his affections, which alſo muſt be ſpiritualized and renewed; for if a man be in Chriſt, he hath mortified the Fleſh and the Luſts thereof, and if the Thoughts be duly placed on God, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings flowing from him, it may be the more eaſy to regulate the affections.</p>
            <p>It is certain while we are in the Body, there is an unavoidable converſation with the Creature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and the degeneracy hath ſo much prevailed, that even in the renewed, there is a law of the Members againſt the Law of the Mind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Life is a conſtant Warfare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. and for this reaſon great care muſt be taken to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the affections, and although it is impoſſible in ſome reſpects, to keep the affections from carnal objects, however the renewed man muſt mortify the Fleſh and Affections thereof: and as helps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we muſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Diſtinguiſh between giving our Affections wholly to any Creature, as reſting on that as our chief good, and ſo delighting in it, and between letting out our deſires to any Creature, in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Creator, in ſome lawful end, and in this conſideration we are to love nothing intenſively, with our whole delight and ſatisfaction, except God, who alone is able to fill the deſires of our Heart, but we may in moderation uſe and take ſome complacency in the Creature, as helps from God to aſſiſt us in our Pilgrim ſtate, to advance his Honour and diſcharge our Duty to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt conſider that ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Judgment of the Curſe is fallen on all Creatures, and the Creation is brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65284:102"/> the Bondage of Corruption, and the Creatures are fallen under the King of this World, as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture for Sin, and the Devil made Prince of the Power of the Air, and this World put under his Dominion (though under reſtraint) from God, and that the Natural Man, or Love of the World, is enmity to God. <hi>He that loveth the World, the love of God is not in him,</hi> John 1.2, 15. and by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> the friendſhip of the World is enmity with God; whoſoever therefore will be a Friend of the World is the Enemy of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We muſt conſider, that Chriſts Errand to the World was to reconcile God to Man, and therefore he humbled himſelf by taking upon him the Nature of Man, and reſtored it from the vanity and impurity of Sin, to all ſuch as ſhall believe in him: for though the whole Creation was ſubjected to ſervitude for Sin, nevertheleſs Chriſt by his coming and ſuffering, hath paid the Ranſom for Believers, and for them removed the Curſe from the Creatures; <hi>Becauſe the Creatures alſo ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God, for we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travaileth in pain together until now,</hi> Rom. 8.21, 22. Hence then meaſures may be taken to regulate our Affections.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We ought to love God and ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on him, above all things, and in loving of him we cannot go the due length, much leſs be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhould love nothing beneath Chriſt, but in ſubordination to him, and in reference to his glory, and that we may the better ſerve him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In our uſe of the World, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Worlds degeneracy, and as in that ſtate it is accurſed, and the love thereof is enmity to God,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65284:103"/> ſo that if we be not our ſelves reconciled to God, all the Creatures are accurſed to us, and we uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of them, ſo that we muſt uſe them as purified to us from the impurity of the Curſe, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and all in a mortified manner, according to the Will of God; <hi>Be not conformed to this World, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds, that ye may prove what is the good, perfect, and acceptable Will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2.</p>
            <p>In the uſe of the Creatures, We muſt uſe them without ſenſual affectation, as things that have a ſtamp of danger in them, with fear, leſt we be again enticed to ſin againſt God, in our delight in any thing more, or ſo much as in God, and that we be with the Apoſtle mortified to all things, <hi>I am crucified to the World, and the World to me,</hi> in that often repeated place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20 Thus then muſt mans Affections be regulated as a new Man, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the old Luſts of the Fleſh, and knowing nothing after the Fleſh; the Children of God are all incorporated into a new ſociety in Chriſt Jeſus, and muſt needs have their Converſation different from the World: <hi>Ye are no more Strangers and Forreigners, but Fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſehold of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.19. Therefore they muſt love and delight in Holy and Spiritual things.</p>
            <p>They are no more <hi>under the Law of Sin to Death, but under the Law of the Spirit unto Life, they are not to walk after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 2, 12, 13, 14. Chriſt himſelf knowing how mans Affections are apt to incline to Earthly Vanities, and ſink under the delight of the Creatures, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to lay up Treaſure in Heaven, <hi>Where your Treaſures are, there your Hearts will be alſo.</hi> Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, let us follow that choice directory for Holineſs and Heavenly mindedneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.31, to 35.</p>
            <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65284:103"/>
            <p>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek theſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, ſet your Affections on things in Heaven, and not things on Earth, for ye are Dead, and your Life is hid with Chriſt in God, Mortifie therefore your Members which are on Earth. Fornication, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inordinate Affections, Evil Concupiſcence and Covetouſneſs, which is Idolatry, ſeeing you have put off the Old Man with his Deeds, and have put on the New Man, which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that Created him, put on therefore as the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, long Suffering, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing one another, forgiving one another, put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. all.</p>
            <p>See the Inſtructions for our Holy and Heavenly Converſation, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. all, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.22. to end, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. all they that are in Chriſt, have Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fleſh, and the Luſts thereof, if we live in the ſpirit, let us alſo walk in the ſpirit, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.24, and 25. Thus then we ſee how Chriſtians are to govern their affections, next we come to conſider their Actions, As the Chriſtian is and muſt be a New Creature, and Holy in all manner of Converſation, ſo muſt he be in his Actions, in two reſpects</p>
            <p>Firſt, They muſt be all Juſt and Holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They muſt be directed to proper ends.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As a Mans Thoughts ought to be pure, and Affections clean, ſo muſt his Actions; for one piece polluted, defileth the whole Lump, and a good Tree produceth good Fruit, and there can be no pretence of uprightneſs in any Man, where the Actions or Converſation is Corrupt, ſo that all Actions of a Man muſt be ſquared by the Word of God, and if diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65284:104"/> thereto, the Concluſion muſt be, that the Fountain is corrupt, for as a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit, ſo a good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit, for the Tree is known by its Fruits, and it is no Juſtification of an Action bad in it ſelf, that it is intended well, for we muſt not do evil, that good may come of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the Actions muſt be in themſelves good, they muſt alſo be directed to the right end, that is, to wit, the glory of God, for what is not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſo, are ſinful before God; <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, may plainly appear, that though the Chriſtian as a New Man in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, is an excellent Creature, as made partaker of the Divine Nature, Nevertheleſs he is, and muſt be intangled in a continual Warfare, whilſt in the Body, and therefore not to be idle or lazy, but to ſtand always upon guard, againſt Enemies within himſelf and without.</p>
            <p>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, for we wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, and againſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of Darkneſs in this World, againſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedneſſes in high places, wherefore take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the whole Armor of God, your Loyns girt about with Truth, the Breaſt Plate of Righteouſneſs, your Feet ſhod with the Goſpel of Peace, the ſhield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, praying and watching, ſo that the Work of a Chriſtian is not over, even when he hath attained newneſs of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, but of neceſſity muſt continue in a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State, while in a Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. to 19.</p>
            <p>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk you in him, Chriſtians muſt fight offenſively, to ſubdue the continued growing of Luſts; Defenſively, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65284:104"/> continued Temptations, and perſevere to the further Conqueſt of Enemies within themſelves, and without in the World, <hi>Watch and Pray, leſt ye enter into Temptation:</hi> in this caſe three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Perſeverance and continued Stedfaſtneſs is the Chriſtians commanded Duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods Promiſes to his People, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſtrengthen them in their Duties and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The experience of Chriſtians, that they thrive and grow, when in purſuit of, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their Duties.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt it plainly appears, as the Chriſtians Life is a continued warfare, ſo muſt he not be lazy or draw back, but be ſtill in Arms ready to fight.</p>
            <p>He that putteth his Hand to the Plough, muſt not draw back, and if any Man draw back, my Soul hath no delight in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.62. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. The whole Book of Holy Writ, is full of this Command, we are not to ſtop or reſt in our Courſe, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in imitation of Chriſt, to run the Race that is ſet before us, without regard to the difficulties in our way, but with Courage to continue our progreſs, till we come to the end of our Stage, even Eternity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. This is Chriſts expreſs Command, we muſt take up our Croſs, and daily follow him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. to end. Nothing muſt ſtop our courſe, however ſo dear to us, Honour, Wealth, Relations, nor Life it ſelf, we muſt give up, and Sacrifice all upon the Altar of Obedience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Ch.</hi> 24.42. to end, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33. to end.</p>
            <p>Let us fear, a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, leſt any of you ſhould come ſhort of it, let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt, leſt any Man fall by unbelief; ſeeing then we have a great High Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65284:105"/> the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 11, 14.

Let us not be weary in well doing, for in ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk ye in him, rooted and built upon him, and eſtabliſhed in the Faith, abounding therein, with Thanks giving, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. to 19.

Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour, whom reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith, knowing that the ſame Afflictions are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in your Brethren, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. giving all diligence, add to your Faith Vertue, and to your Vertue Knowledge, and to your Knowledge, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaance, and to Temperance, Patience, and to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

Hence we ſee how incumbent it is to Chriſtians, to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Duty of Perſeverance, and as the ſtate of the Militant Church is Laborious and full of Hazards, and expoſed to Difficulties inſuperable, as to Man, and the Adverſaries in themſelves powerful, Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as no Man goeth to War at his own Charge, but at the charge of him whoſe Soldier he is, neither hath the King of Kings, whoſe Soldiers Chriſtians are, left his People, without aſſurances of ſure pay and conſtant ſupplies out of the Treaſury of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was almoſt tyred out, and his Patience worn, how long wilt thou forget me, for ever, how long wilt thou hide thy Face from me, how long ſhall I take Counſel in my Soul, having ſorrow in my Heart, how long ſhall mine Enemies be exalted over me? but whilſt he is continuing in his Application to God is ſtrengthned and at laſt concludes, but I have truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy Mercies, my Heart will rejoyce in thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I will ſing unto the Lord, becauſe he hath dealt bountifully with me, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27.13, 14. all. This Holy Man continuing in Duty with God, was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by his Confidence in God. I had fainted in mine Affliction, unleſs I had believed to ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living, wait on the Lord, and be of good Courage, and he will ſtrengthen thy Heart, wait, I ſay, on the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 27.13, 14.</p>
            <p>When he had Experienced great Afflictions in his Family, and a long continuance of it, he could at laſt ſay, ſing unto the Lord O ye Saints of his, and give Thanks at the Remembrance of his Holineſs, for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65284:108"/> his Anger endureth but for a Moment, in his Favour is Life, weeping may endure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 30.4 5.</p>
            <p>Though he was laſhed with <hi>Shimei's</hi> Tongue, yet he could ſay, thou ſhalt hide him in the Secret of thy Preſence, from the Pride of Man, thou ſhalt keep them ſecretly in thy Pavilion, from the ſtrife of Tongues, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.21. Though he was forced to ſculk and hide, and ſaid, I ſhall one Day fall into the Hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> then he could ſay, thou art my hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place, thou ſhalt compaſs me about in trouble with Songs of Deliverance, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.8.</p>
            <p>When this Holy Man takes Breath from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and reflects on Gods Diſpenſations to him, how ſweetly doth he ſet forth the many Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Priviledges, of ſuch as wait on God? his Eyes are upon them, and his Ears open to their Cry, The Lord heareth them, he delivereth them from all their Troubles, he is near to the broken in Heart, and loveth the Contrite Spirit, he delivereth them out of all their Afflictions, not one of their Bones are broken, thoſe that hate the Righteous ſhall be Deſolate, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34.15. to end.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtles were never more Thriving and Couragious, than under their greateſt Sufferings, we are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but not in deſpair, perſecuted, but not forſaken, caſt down, but not deſtroyed, knowing that he which raiſed the Lord Jeſus, ſhall alſo raiſe us, and preſent us with you, for which cauſe we faint not, for though our outward Man periſh, yet our inward Man is renewed Day by Day, for our light Afflictions which are but for a Moment, worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and an Eternal Weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, to end, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15. to 11. And again that ſame Apoſtle, teſtifieth this truth, I would have you to underſtand, that the things which have fallen out to me, are for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65284:108"/> the furtherance of the Goſpel, many of the Brethren in the Lord waxing confident in my Bonds, are much more bold to ſpeak the word without fear, <hi>Phi.</hi> 1.12. to 21. and elſewhere he ſaith, for which cauſe I alſo ſuffer theſe things, Nevertheleſs, I am not aſhamed, for I know in whom I have believed, and he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that Day, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. The whole Scriptures and other Hiſtories, make mention of the growth and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Saints, now in Glory, who with great Stability and Patience, have run their Courſe, and at the height of their Tragical Sufferings, have ſhewed more Courage and Reſolution, than when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Race.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children, <hi>Job, Jeremiah,</hi> and the Prophets grew ſtronger and ſtronger, under their Duties of Continuing in well doing, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Stephen</hi> finiſhed his Courſe with Joy, praiſing of God, and praying for his Enemies, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59, 60.</p>
            <p>The third thing conſiderable in this Conflict of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and Saints Warfare, is the Comfort the Saints have in a Sanctified uſe of all Diſpenſations and Enjoyments, of what they meet with in their Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, to have any thing, and not enjoy it, or to want the grace and liberty of right improving of it, is a Curſe, and not a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Experience teacheth, that many Worldly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, or Miſers, have much of the Worlds Wealth, Riches, and great poſſeſſions, and yet their Hearts and Affections are ſo forfeited and glutted with the love and delight thereof, that they are ſlaves to their fancy, and delight therein, ſo as they cannot allow to themſelves, the Comfortable uſe thereof, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hoard them up (as the Idols of their phancy) to ſuch as come after them, or on the other Hand, glut and ſatiate themſelves therewith, and have not the Grace or Heart to Communicate them in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65284:109"/> to the neceſſity of others, as the Rich Glutton in the Goſpel, who belike did gratifie his Dogs, rather than <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his wants, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. to end.</p>
            <p>Although the wiſe diſpoſer of all things, makes his Sun to ſhine on the Godly and the Wicked, and moſt frequently gives more plentifully of the things of this Life to the Wicked, than to the Godly, nevertheleſs his Diſpenſations thereof is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, They are given to the Wicked as Snares, a Curſe and their Portion, and with them Eternal Wrath, for their miſ-improvement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are given to the Godly, only as a means of Subſiſtance in their Journey Heaven-ward, with Contentment and the Sanctified uſe thereof, with a promiſe of Eternal Life in Jeſus Chriſt, as their Portion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is moſt certain, and Conſequential in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that where the things of this Life are given, and the Heart and Delight is fixed on them as their full and ſole Satisfaction, theſe things are Curſes, Snares and Entangle the Soul in Miſery, and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſuch as place not their Content, Delight, Satisfaction and Happineſs in Chriſt, are Wicked, and Eternally Accurſed, and therefore all their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Snares, and Curſes, and they are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Enjoyment thereof, and this is evidently proved,</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that as it hath been already ſhewn, that Mans Apoſtacy by ſin hath brought that Curſe on the Creature, ſo as the love of the World is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and the lawful uſe of the Creature is only procured by Chriſts Mediation, to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</p>
            <p>So that whatſoever love to the Creature, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments thereof is not for Chriſt, and founded on him, is a Curſe, and not a Bleſſing: and this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65284:109"/> illuſtrated from Reaſon, for that Firſt, where Contentment cannot be found, there is no Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is no ſatisfaction to be found in any thing, without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is clear in reaſon and common opinion, which place Happineſs in Satisfaction of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires, and whatſoever Enjoyment comes not that length, is ſhort of Happineſs, and brings Anxiety and Diſcontent. And this is clear from Common Experience; for let a Man have Wealth, if he have not Health, Strength and Vigor, let him have Riches, and if he have not Honour, let him have one hundred Enjoyments, if any one thing be wanting, which either ſome other hath, or he ſhall pleaſe his fancy upon, he is not content, ſo not Happy, becauſe his Affections or fancy are not pleaſed, and if we conſult <hi>Solomon,</hi> the greateſt in Experience, we may conclude, that Happineſs in Creature Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not attainable.</p>
            <p>The Second is alſo Demonſtrate from Reaſon and Experience, it being moſt conſonant to Reaſon, that no contentment can be found, but in that which is permanent and perfect, for that Mans Nature is for Novelties, and cannot reſt on any one thing, when ſomething elſe occurs, which either excelleth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or he doth fancy it doth and indeed it were beneath the Dignity of the Soul, (which is of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Extract) to bottom on any thing, which is not of greateſt value; beſides the Soul being a Spirit; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not place and confine its delight, to what is only ſenſual, unleſs it could give ſatisfaction to the Soul, or Fancy, and that no Satisfaction can be had in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Enjoyments, is apparent from the Nature of all Created beings.</p>
            <p>That Holy Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> Exhorting againſt the Love of the World, ſaith, <hi>Love not the World, nor the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65284:110"/> things of the World, for in the World, there is the Luſt of the Eyes, the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, and theſe things periſh in the uſing, but he that doth the Will of God ſhall endure for ever;</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſets forth before us the Inventory or Scheme of the World in theſe three; where by the Luſts he means the Objects, and the delights taken in them.</p>
            <p>That we may the better diſcover, That nothing in this World can give ſatisfaction, or is perfect or permanent, we ſhall conſider the World and all things in it, in theſe three circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By the Luſts of the Fleſh muſt be meant, all ſenſual Objects, and the pleaſure taken in them; and that there is neither permanency nor perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is proved from the Text, ſo it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, from all the inſtances of ſenſual objects: are Riches the object? they take the Wings of the Wind and fly away, a man may be found Rich to Day, and a Begger next, as was ſaid of <hi>Craeſus</hi> who was reputed the richeſt on Earth, <hi>Irus &amp; eſt hodie, qui modo Craeſus eras,</hi> they either torment a man in getting, keeping, or increaſing of them: the Apoſtle tells us they leave a man in this Life or at his Death, and in the mean time load a Man with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cares, ſnares, and troubles, ſo as their uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is clear, <hi>We brought nothing to this World with us, and it is certain we ſhall carry nothing out of it, the love of Money is the Root of all evil, and they that will be rich fall into many temptations, and ſnares, and many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men into deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Perdition,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. to 11.</p>
            <p>See Chriſts own Teſtimony of Riches, and what clog it is to a Mans Soul, whileſt looking after better things, <hi>It is as impoſſible for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; as for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle,</hi> Luke 19.20, to 25. chap. 6.24.

            <p>The Luſts of the Eyes comprehend all that is taking or delightful to the Sight, and what can that be, but what is either the contemplation of our own beauty, or outward excellencies, or the glory of other Creatures? our own may wither, and Age and Sickneſs, and other viciſſitudes make it decay, our Infirmities or thouſands of accidents can ſoon make all without us taſteleſs and inſipid to us: beſides as all Fleſh is Graſs, and wither as the Green Herbs, ſo as there is no permanency in any thing to raiſe felicity from the Eyes, it is not long before theſe Glaſs Windows ſhall be ſhut, the Silver threads be cut, and the golden bowl be broken at the Well by Death, and thereby the glory of the whole Houſe be darkned, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. to 9.</p>

               </gap> third thing which compleats this pittiful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of the World, is the Pride of Life, and what is that but a ſhadow to the Luſt of Humane Glory, and vain Titles of Honour or Preferment in this World? and how ſhort this is of permanency and happineſs, experience tells us.</p>
            <p>There is no ſtinting of Mans Ambition, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Pride reſts not in one Title, but Envies, and Ambitions another, and at beſt all theſe are but fanciful, and have no intrinſick worth in them, and are only valuable as Fancy eſteems them.</p>

            <p>How was the Glory and Pride of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> laid to the Ground, when he was turned from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his glorious Canopy of State, and rich embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery, and from wearing a Crown of pure Gold, ſent to feed and lodge amongſt the Beaſts until his Hair became like Birds Feathers, and his Nails like Eaglés Claws, and he forced to acknowledge his own nothingneſs and Gods Soveraignty, <hi>All whoſe Works are Truth, and his ways Judgment, and thoſe who walk in Pride he is able to abaſe?</hi> Dan. 4.30, to end.</p>

            <p>How was the Blaſphemous Pride and Ambition of <hi>Senacherib</hi> and <hi>Rabſecah</hi> againſt God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, puniſhed by Gods miraculous raiſing the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by ſending forth his Angel, and killing fourſcore and ten thouſand men in the Camp of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and when <hi>Senacherib</hi> fled and at his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Devotion, God raiſed up his own Sons to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g Food and Raiment let us be therewith content?</p>
            <p>For anſwer we may take up the word content, to ſignify the placing our ſole and full ſatisfaction on ſome object, without deſiring any farther; and in that ſenſe, it is unlawful to place our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any Creature: or content may ſignify, an acquieſcence in the uſe of any Creature Enjoyment, in the meaſure, time, and towards the end it is given us, as being contented with ſo much of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as God will give us for our uſe in this Life, without murmuring or ſtinting of him to time or meaſure, and in this ſenſe is the Apoſtle's meaning, as he explains himſelf, <hi>I have learned how to want, and how to abound, and in every condition therein to be content,</hi> Phil. 4.11, 12, And yet he longed for Chriſt and Eternal Life, and gloried in nothing but in the Croſs of Chriſt, by whom the World was Crucified to him, and he to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. So that though he uſed the World with contentment, that is, with acquieſcence, it was not his full ſatisfaction and reſt, but Chriſt was his end he drove at, in that uſe of the Creature.</p>
            <p>Now as from what hath been ſaid, we ſee the things of this Life, though they make no happineſs,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65284:112"/> they are given both to the Godly and to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. but with theſe differences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Godly have them as owning them from God, the Wicked aſcribe them to themſelves, or their own induſtry, or ſuppoſe they have them by chance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are given to the Godly, as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Journey to Heaven or Travelling expences, but the Wicked have them as their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are given to the Godly with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Will of God, in time, manner and quantity, but to the Wicked with murmuring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, and covetouſneſs after more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are given to the Godly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for Gods Glory, but the Wicked ſpend them on their Luſts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Godly have the Bleſſing of owning the diſpenſation of all things to them as from God, that they are all made, created, and ſupported by him, and that they do all flow from him of his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure; For by him were all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and for him, and all things conſiſt by him, and he is before all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17. Every good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Light, with whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſhadow of turning, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> aſcribeth all his Power, Greatneſs and Grandure to God; He ſent from above and took me from many Waters, he delivered me from my ſtrong Enemies, and from them which hated me, for they were too ſtrong for me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.16, 17, 18, 19, 31, to 41. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. to 4.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand the Wicked boaſt of their own ſtrength, glory, and greatneſs, and aſcribe all to themſelves, as if they were the original of their own glory and greatneſs. Is not this great <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65284:112"/> ſaith <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which I have built for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my Majeſty and Glory of my Kingdom? <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Rabſecah</hi>'s boaſting, Where are the Gods of <hi>Havah,</hi> and the Gods of the City of <hi>Sephervaim?</hi> Who are they of all the Gods of the Countreys, that they ſhould deliver them out of my Hand? Thus the Wicked boaſt themſelves, and give not the glory to God, 2 <hi>Kin</hi> 19.35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond difference is that the Godly have all allowances as helps, and not as their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the Wicked have them as their all, and their Portions; See what Chriſt ſaith to the Rich Glutton, he had his Portion in this Life, and is chained up in everlaſting darkneſs and miſery, but poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> though he was glad of the Crumbs from under the Rich Mans Table, is placed in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Paradiſe of happineſs. The Arms of the Wicked ſhall be broken, but the Lord upholdeth the Righteous, and their Inheritance ſhall be for ever, the Wicked ſhall periſh, and be as the fat of Lambs, they ſhall conſume away, into ſmoak ſhall they conſume, ſuch as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the Earth, and they that be curſed of him ſhall be cut off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.16, to 29.</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf adviſeth his People not to be anxious or make proviſion for the Fleſh, for that he will take care of them, but againſt the Wicked whoſe care is only for this World, he pronounceth Curſes, Wo to you that are Rich for ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your conſolation, wo to you that are full for ye ſhall hunger; wo to you that laugh now for ye ſhall mourn and weep, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20, to 26.</p>
            <p>The third difference is, That the Godly receives theſe things with a humble and thankful mind, with ſubmiſſion to the Will of God, in giving, taking away, or continuing, but the wicked fret, repine
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65284:113"/> and murmur at every eclipſe or change, whereby his Condition ſeemeth to be worſted, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly curſeth God in his Heart, when he hath not his full deſire, I create the fruit of the Lips, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord, but there is no peace to the Wicked, ſaith my God, the Wicked are like <hi>the raging Sea, caſting up dirt and mire,</hi> Iſa. 57.19, 20, 21. Hence then ſee the different complexion of the Godly and Wicked, the one patiently ſubmitting, the other conſtantly murmuring; how patiently did <hi>Job</hi> bear the loſs of his Children and vaſt Eſtate? The Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord; in all this <hi>Job</hi> ſinned not, neither charged God fooliſhly in his Heart, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, ſee the reſtleſs and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable malice of Satan to perſecute, <hi>Job,</hi> Job 2. to 6.</p>
            <p>How patiently did <hi>David</hi> ſubmit himſelf, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the revilings, curſings, and reproaches of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> and the King ſaid, let him curſe, for the Lord hath ſaid to him, curſe <hi>David,</hi> who then ſhall ſay why haſt thou done it? my Son which came out of my Bowels ſeeketh my Life, how much more may this Benjamite do it? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>See on the other hand the tragical turbulency, and murmuring temper of the Wicked, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> whoſe Counſel with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolom</hi> uſed to be as of an Angel of Light, becauſe his Counſel was rejected, in the Pride of his Heart he hanged himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23.</p>
            <p>The fourth difference of Gods diſpenſations to the Godly and Wicked is, That the Godly are directed and aſſiſted of God, to level all their actions, and apply all that is diſpenſed to them, for the Glory and Honour of God; but the Wicked apply all to the gratifying of their Luſts; the Godly believe, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65284:113"/> all things as well in proſperity as in adverſity, work together for their good; therefore they level all their purpoſes and actions at his glory, <hi>Romans</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deborah</hi> though by God made eminently inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in that great victory over Gods Enemies, takes not the glory thereof to her ſelf, but aſcribes it to God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. all.</p>
            <p>The great Steward of Heaven diſpenſeth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this Life, as the Lord in the Goſpel gave forth his Talents to ſuch as did profit by them, he truſted them with more, and gave them Eternal Life, as the reward of their care for their Maſters Honour and Profit; but the ſlothful and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants are caſt into utter darkneſs, where they ſhall meet with nothing but <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 25.14, to 31.</p>
            <p>Having thus curſorily made enquiry into the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of all humane enjoyments, and diſcovered that no happineſs can be found therein, we come next to inquire into that compleat felicity of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, which is the fourth thing treaſured up in that bank of Mercy for Believers, and that under theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The freedom of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The fulneſs of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, of the freedom, as all temporal Mercies are of God, as we have already diſcovered, ſo alſo, all Spiritual allowances are of him, and from him, he is the Father of Spirits, and of his free will he hath begotten us by regeneration in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath purchaſed us with the price of his Blood, God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.17. When we were without ſtrength Chriſt died for us. God commendeth his Love to us in that while we were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65284:114"/> yet Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt died for us, That as Sin reigned unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life through Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. to end. It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16.</p>
            <p>For by Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, not of works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9.</p>
            <p>In hope of Eternal Life which God that cannot lye promiſed before the World began, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>Having Predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, in whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins according to the riches of his Grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5, 7.</p>
            <p>Thus we plainly ſee the freedom of this gift of Eternal Life, though purchaſed by the Death of Chriſt, yet freely given to us by him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing we are to conſider of, is the fulneſs of this great gift, and for the clearer diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, we ſhall compare the excellencies of it, with the things of this Life, in all the advantagious circumſtances of the ſame, whereby we ſhall find the excellencies thereof, incomparably excel all that can be pretended deſireable in this Life, in all their ſuperlative ſtate and condition.</p>
            <p>The glory, fulneſs and excellency of this World, is laid down by the Apoſtle in the foregoing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to conſiſt in the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, and theſe things periſh in the uſing, but he that doth the Will of God abideth for ever: theſe being put in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with eternal Life and its excellencies, we ſhall eaſily find there can be no parrallel when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and believe the Teſtimony of that Evangelical
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65284:114"/> Prophet, Eye hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what great things he hath laid up for ſuch as wait on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.4.</p>
            <p>Hence we may ſee an ineſtimable difference, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the enjoyments of this Life are only ſenſual and vaniſhing, and the others are all Spiritual and Laſting to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider the World as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle deſcribes it, and that <hi>The Love of the World is not of the Father,</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> that <hi>it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God,</hi> and that eternal life is the purchaſe of Chriſts Blood, how much will this ſink the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we compare the Worlds Inventory, that in it is only the <hi>Luſts of the Eyes, the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life,</hi> How ſoon is this caſt out of the Scales by the Apoſtle? <hi>The Kingdom of God conſiſts not in eating and drinking, chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, but in Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> When all that is ſaid or can be ſaid of the World is ſummed up,</p>
            <p>Firſt, In Eating and Drinking.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Apparel to cloath our nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Friends or Relations. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In Riches or Wealth: all which periſh in the uſing as is often demonſtrated; what Parallel then can be imagined between theſe two? For our better ſatisfaction, we ſhall examine all theſe ſeverally by themſelves and thoſe things which come in exchange of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Cloaths of the beſt, Richeſt or Gordious ſort which can be invented, afford no cauſe of glory, pride, ſatisfaction, or content, for at beſt they are but badges of our Sin and Miſery, and cauſes of grief, mourning, humiliation, and repentance, for that they were at firſt upon <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion invented to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65284:115"/> cover our nakedneſs, diſcovered by ſin, which firſt brought ſhame, and therefore they are but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of our ſhame and nakedneſs, in which we ſhould neither delight not glory, but rather on ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of humble our ſelves in the ſenſe of our original guilt and loſt eſtate in <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3.7, to 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The beſt of Garments have under them infirm Bodies, tainted with natural weakneſs at beſt, and ſometimes the Richeſt cover the fraileſt Carcaſe, tainted with noiſome Diſtempers, the ſight of which may make the Garments and what is under them loathſome and abhorrent; ſo that what we have for our neceſſity, to cover our ſhame, and hide our loathſomneſs, ſhould not be our Pride, much leſs our Delight or Glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Cloaths are often our Burthen, when either by penury we cannot attain to them, or the perſons are ſo weak that they cannot bear them in Winter to defend the cold, nor in Summer becauſe of heat.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The faſhion changeth and frets the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent that they cannot have them, and draws the richer to exceſs, emulation and prodigality in fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and unneceſſary pomp in the change of faſhions, to the exciting of Luſt and ſuperflous waſting what better may be beſtowed on the poor, whom God recommends as objects of Charity.</p>
            <p>This being the badge of our ſhame and ſin, and the ſuperfluity thereof ſo much abounding now a days, it is worth conſideration to reflect on the great threatnings denounced againſt ſuch vanity and ſuperfluity by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> eſpecially againſt the Pride of Women. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite them with a ſcab, and diſcover their ſecret parts, and take away all their bravery, and their round tires like the Moon, the changeable ſuits of Aparrel, the Mantles, Wimples, and Criſping Pins, the Glaſſes, fine Linnen, Hoods and Vails,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65284:115"/> inſtead of a ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtench, inſtead of a girdle a rent, inſtead of well ſet Hair Baldneſs, inſtead of a Stomacher a Girdle of Sackcloath, and burning inſtead of Beauty,</hi> Iſ. 3.16. to end.</p>
            <p>This being one great Idol of the fleſh and our ſhame, let us ſee how this Luſt of the fleſh is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to the godly and glorified Believers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that all their Sins, and conſequently their ſhame are taken away in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>For as in</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>all died, even ſo are all made alive in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear thou not, for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed, neither ſhalt thou be confounded, for thou ſhalt not be put to ſhame, thou ſhalt forget the ſhame o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thy youth, and ſhalt not remember the Reproach of thy Widow-hood any more, for thy Maker is thy Huſband,</hi> Iſa. 54.4.</p>
            <p>The Saints of God have the rotten Garments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes, and have made themſelves white in the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7.14, Thus the Saints of God as Inhabitants of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being Cloathed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, are cleanſed from all ſin and ſhame, and ſo have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Cloaths to cover ſin or ſhame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Saints have no occaſion for Cloaths, to Comfort the weakneſs of their Bodies, for that when raiſed from the Dead, they ſhall not have Corrupt Bodies of Corruptible Elements, but ſhall be Clothed with Spiritual and Incorruptible Bodies, not ſubject to change, nor tainted with infirmities of Nature, Hunger, or Cold, <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Incorruption; for this Corruptible muſt put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this Mortal muſt put on immortality,</hi> 1 Cor.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65284:116"/> 15.50, 52, 53. So that they ſhall have no occaſion of the Corruptible Rags of moſt Sumptuous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; how much then have the Saints tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory the Advantage over ſuch, whoſe Earthy and Craſy Corps, muſt be Clothed with rotte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to cover their ſhame, ſin and nakedneſs, and defend their infirm Bodies from offence of Cold, and Heat, of which the Saints are not ſenſible?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Eating and Drinking being the ſecond Branch of the Luſts of the Fleſh, it is ſo groſs a predominant and neceſſity of Nature and weak Mortality, that it is not only the peculiar Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Bruits, beneath the Dignity of Mans Soul, and as it is the neceſſity of Nature, ſo it is the great burden of Nature, to be under that neceſſity, that ſome Senſualiſts, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>whoſe God is their Belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind Earthly things,</hi> and Human Experience tells us, how far this Tyranny upon Man ſo prevails, that their luxuriant Appetite, never ſuffer them to be at eaſe, but either after the quantity or variety of eating and drinking, they are hurryed with further deſire, and thereby often miſerably loaded with hurtful diſeaſes, thus delicate Mortals are plunged in miſery, by that they ſo much delight in, this was the Caſe of the Rich Glutton in the Goſpel, but on the other hand, the Saints in Heaven are not Afflicted with troubleſom Appetites, for they <hi>feed on the Manna, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, for they ſhall Hunger no more, nor Thirſt any more, for the Lamb ſhall feed them, and lead them to living Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Rev. 21.4, 6. their feeding is their Eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding God and the Lamb, but the Wicked feeds on the Eternal Wrath of God, <hi>if any Man Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark on his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or in his Hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out into the Cup of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65284:116"/> his Indignation, and he ſhall be Tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third Branch of the Luſts of the Fleſh, is that inſatiable Appetite, the World hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Riches of this Life: what hath already been ſaid of the uncertainty, emptineſs and vanities of Human Riches, in the foregoing caſe of the Rich Glutton, and the many Inſtances of that Nature, may give the Complexion of that State: and what Chriſt ſaith of the Rich Man, that it is hard for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and that the Rich have received their Conſolation and Portion in this Life, do all ſufficiently illuſtrate the Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and Miſery of that Life, if not rich towards God; but on the other Hand, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of God, Mat.</hi> 5.3. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians though never ſo poor in this World, have all things in Chriſt, <hi>They are Sons and Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 8.17, 32. all which ſhew how far the State of the Godly, though Poor in this Life, exceed the Condition of the wicked, though rich as <hi>Craeſus,</hi> if not rich towards God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the fourth Branch of the Luſts of the Fleſh, is the pleaſure Men in this World take in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Friends, and Companions: but what is ſaid before of this, what Chriſt ſaith, who loveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Children, Relations, Life it ſelf, or any thing elſe better than him, is not worthy of him, and whoſoever looſeth any of theſe things for his ſake, ſhall have double in Heaven, is ſufficient to give us a Parallel of the State of the Godly and the Wicked, who Luſt after the Fleſh; but let us ſee what account the Apoſtle gives of a far better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Saints have made of the choiceſt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but <hi>we are come into</hi> Mount Sion, <hi>the City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>unto an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65284:117"/> Company of Angels, into the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was weary of the Society of wicked Men, <hi>wo is me, that I dwell in</hi> Meſheck, <hi>and Sojourn in the Tents of</hi> Cedar; ſo when the Saints are ſure that <hi>he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell with them,</hi> they will freely part with the Company of Sinful Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 120.5.</p>
            <p>The Luſts of the Eyes being the ſecond part of the Worlds Inventory, we ſhall examine it with the excellent diſcovery of the Saints Light, the Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more curious and choice Organ of Natural and Senſual Underſtanding and Delight, the right Frame and Complexion thereof affords a Man the greateſt Satisfaction of all Senſual Faculties, and yet we ſee how frail and weak it is at beſt, ſooneſt and eaſieſt wounded and diminiſhed by Age or Accidents, and muſt needs have ſupports by glaſſes in Old Age, or otherwiſe, and at laſt it wholy fails at Death, whereby we find theſe two defects in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is but weak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It altogether fails at Death. <hi>The Silver Threads are cut, and the Golden Bowl broken at the Well, Ecl.</hi> 12. to 6. read all.</p>
            <p>In theſe Conſiderations, the godly have much the Advantage, for when inlightned they are made of a ſpiritual Frame ſtrong and vigorous, as being built on Chriſt the Rock of Ages by Faith, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in him, and Tranſlated into Glory, can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no defect, nor be ſubject to any Infirmity, <hi>you hath he quickened, who were once Dead in ſin, he hath quickened us together in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.1.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt being once raiſed from the Dead, was
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65284:117"/> reed of all further Natural Infirmities, even ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Sinners even in this Life, have the Cataracts and Scales of Natural Darkneſs taken off, as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enlightned, and made partakers of the Divine Nature, and are taught to ſee and underſtand the Myſteries of God and Godlineſs, which the Natural Man knoweth not, nor can underſtand; <hi>to be Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, becauſe the Carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can he, the Carnal Man receiveth not the things of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are Spiritually diſcerned, but he that is Spiritual, judgeth all things,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7. <hi>for who have known the mind of the Lord, that he may inſtruct him? but we have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſtians having the Eyes of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enlightned, they can ſee and underſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, for they walk and ſee by Faith, and not by Senſe, and being here as to the World Strangers, and not minding the World in a Carnal Method, as Worldlings do, and as diſ intereſſed, they do impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially make the more certain obſervation and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things of this Life, <hi>therefore we are always confident, knowing that while in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord, for we walk by Faith, not by Sight, we are confident and willing to be abſent from the Body, and be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.9. The Saints have yet a further excellency in their ſight, for when they are Spiritualized in this Life, and the natural igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance taken off by their ingraftment in Chriſt, when theſe Silver Threads are cut, they are enlightned with the knowledge and ſight which fails not, and united to Chriſt, that firſt and Original Light, and their knowledge is eternal and unextinguiſhable, and augmented to the ſeeing, not only in part as in this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65284:118"/> Life, but <hi>to know as they are known, and to ſee as they ſeen eternally in the Heavens, that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, that they may be perfect in one. We know in part, and we Propheſie in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away; when I was a Child, I ſpoke as a Child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a Child, I thought as a Child, but when I became a Man, I put away Childiſh things, for now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as alſo I am known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>In this ſide of time, our Eyes are blurred with Sorrow and Grief, and our ſight marred, but in the Tranſlation, all Tears ſhall be wiped away from our Eyes, <hi>there ſhall be no night there, they ſhall need no Candle, nor light of Sun or Moon, for the Lord giveth them Light.</hi> Hence plainly may appear, the great difference between the Luſts of the Eyes, in a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man, and the Tranſcendent excellencies of the ſight of the Saints in glory, for that the Carnal Eye of the Body can only reach ſenſual Objects, and that under great Infirmities and Weakneſs, but the Spiritual Light reacheth Heavenly Objects, and that in full extent, and continues its ſtrength to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing which makes up the Worlds glory and excellency, is the Pride of Life, by which may be underſtood all Worldly Honour, Credit, Titles, and Preferments, which do chiefly conſiſt, either in naked Titles of Honour, or Titles with Preferment and Benefit attending them, in both which reſpects, we ſhall find that of the glorified Saints, infinitely excell all that can be pretended from the World.</p>
            <p>Worldly Titles of Honour, of the Higheſt Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Degree, as Dukes, Kings, Emperors, and ſuch like, are ſplendid in Carnal Fancy, but having no
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65284:118"/> intrinſick value, depending only upon the frothy Opinion of others, the profeſſors thereof may fall from them, into more Contempt than they were in eſteem by reaſon of their Titles, Power and Glory, as daily experience teacheth, but the Saints are <hi>Sons and Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and their Names, Titles and Dignities are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Records of Heaven, and they are Sealed with Truth that cannot lye, <hi>The grace and calling of God is without Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give a New Name, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Name of Sons and Daughters, the Name of God, and the City of God which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> this is more Honourable, than that of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>George,</hi> or St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> or any of the moſt ſplendid Dignities on Earth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12.</p>
            <p>Theſe Titles are not only glorious, though not made up of the vain and flattering notions of Carnal fancies, and outward gaity and ſhew, but are alſo accompanyed with the richeſt Preferments, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt profit; ſuch as are thus dignified with the Name of God on them, are in the Preſence Chamber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, before the Throne of God Day and Night, <hi>and he that ſitteth on the Throne, dwelleth amongſt them, they ſhall Hunger no more, neither Thirſt any more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Sun light on them, or any Heat,</hi> Rev. 7.15, 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</p>
            <p>Though theſe be not eminent Titles, yet not all, and what the richeſt, greateſt, and moſt generous Princes on Earth cannot give, the Lord gives to the Saints, he makes them Sons and Heirs of his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory, <hi>he that overcometh, ſhall inherit all things, and he ſhall be my Son, and I will be his God,</hi> Rev. 21.7. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, then are ye Heirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe, and joynt Heirs with Chriſt, and becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth this Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, whereby ye cry Abba Father,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65284:119"/> wherefore thou art no more a Servant, but a Son, and if a Son, then a Heir of God through Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.15, 17, 26. He maketh his Saints Co-partners of his own glory with the Father, and placeth them to ſit on the Throne with himſelf, and <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> Jo. 17.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me on my Throne,, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee how far all the Glory, Grandure and Enjoyments of this Life, come ſhort to that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Heaven, and expectation of Believers.</p>
            <p>Having thus viewed the emptineſs of all theſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Earthly pretentions, with the fulneſs of the Saints inheritance, we come now to the anſwer of theſe three foregoing Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Frſt, The Scope of the firſt being, that the Kingdom of Heaven is to be purchaſed on hard Terms, by the loſs of all the Comforts, and what's dear in the World, and that ſuch Doctrine is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageable, and inclines Men to to a taking up with, and delighting in the pleaſures of the Fleſh, by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> advice, rather than in the loſs thereof, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ſeek after ſo hard a bargain, as the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to which, we muſt lead the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector back to the Survey and Conſideration of the two things in Competition, <hi>viz.</hi> Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and things of eternal Life, and when the vanity, uncertainty, and emptineſs of the firſt is conſidered, and compared with the infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and fulneſs in the laſt, and as Heaven is of more value than Earth, ſo theſe earthly things muſt be of leſs eſteem, than theſe Heavenly, and ſeeing in Merchandiſe, and good Husbandry, the value of the thing in purchaſe is conſiderable, beyond the price,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65284:119"/> or in ballance with it, in proſpect of the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that may accrew; ſo that in reaſon, it cannot be pretended, that the getting of Heaven in all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies thereof, can be a hard bargain, though the World under its beſt pretentions, ſhould be given in purchaſe, <hi>For what hath a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul,</hi> Mat. 16.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider God is the Author of life, made Heaven and Earth, and diſpoſes of it at his pleaſure, hath he not then the Terms in his own hand? muſt we cut and carve, and make bargains for our ſelves, and of our ſide only? muſt we have Heaven and Eternal Life, on our Terms, or on Gods Terms? as he have the World to us freely, he may make what Terms he pleaſeth, and if we will not cloſe with God on his Terms, we may, and muſt go without the bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And theſe are Chriſts Terms, he that taketh not up his Croſs Daily, and followeth not me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10.38.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine of ſelf-denyal, Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, and Mortification neither doth, or ſhould diſcourage from the purchaſe of Heaven, for that it doth not forbid the uſe, or comfort of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but commands that it be uſed aright, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of God, <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that eat asking no queſtion for Conſcience ſake, the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25, 26. We are not forbid the uſe, but the abuſe of the Creature, we are Commanded to <hi>Crucifie the fleſh, and the Luſts thereof;</hi> but we are not commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Nature, or Deſpiſe the Moderate uſe of the Creatures, for our Moderate and Temperate Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but forbidden the Ryoting of the Creatures on our Luſts; and though many of Gods People, do voluntarily abſtain from the abuſe and ſuperfluous
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65284:120"/> uſe of the Creature, or that by his Providence, the plenty thereof may ſome time be reſtrained from them, even to ſtreights, yet he ſupplieth that with the Bleſſing of a Contented Submiſſion, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to want, and how to abound, and in every Condition therewith to be content, <hi>Phi</hi> 4.11, 12. and leadeth them to a dependance on himſelf, that he will not ſuffer them to be Tempted above meaſure, but that with every Temptation, he will give an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, that they may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. And make them wait on the appointed time for the viſion, in their greateſt ſtreights, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>We are not forbid the moderate uſe of the World, for ſupply of our Neceſſities, as Mortals, when uſed in the fear of God, and in Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, but we are forbidden placing our Affections on Earthly things, when they come in Competition with Chriſt, his Honour, and Intereſt, and clog our deſires and duties towards God, ſo as not to ſet his glory before us, as the main deſign in every thing.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Solomons</hi> Advice is miſtaken, as if he he ſhould encourage Men to ſatiate, and delight themſelves, only in the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of the Creature, without Dependance on God, or to take that of the Creature for their all, and not mind future Happineſs; he only in experience of Humane vanities, reproves Mens reſting on the Creature, as making an Idol thereof, and adviſeth the moderate uſe of it, without anxiety, in reproof of the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who in the too exceſſive affection of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, take not the free and thankful enjoyment of it, but Covetouſly hoards it up, and makes a God of it, which he accounts fooliſhneſs, and warmly reproves reſting on Creature delights, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The ſecond Objection is, that the Doctrine of Saints ſufferings, ſeems contrary to Scripture, which in many places promiſe peace, Tranquility and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65284:120"/> and plenty to the Church and People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is eaſily anſwered, for either theſe promiſes are to the Church and People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> all which were conditional on their Obedience, and performed to them, when in their Duty, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon their Repentance, until their falling off in Crucifying the Lord of Glory; however, they are ſtill the People of Promiſe, and in his own time, he will bring them to his Marvelous light, and ſhew them his Salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In no place of Scripture, hath the Lord promiſed a conſtant Tyde of Temporary Mercies, but upon their continuing in Duties, and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf the giving and taking them away, at his Will and Pleaſure, and for his own ends in his Divine Wiſdom, and no Man can pretend to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, but he muſt with <hi>David,</hi> and the Church, confeſs, <hi>in Righteouſneſs haſt thou Corrected me, leſs than mine Iniquities do deſerve,</hi> La. 1.18. Cha. 3.39. So we may conclude our wants, Afflictions, and Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are from the Hands of Juſtice for Sin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although the Lord often brings his beſt People under ſore Afflictions, Troubles, and Wants, as experience of all Ages teach us, yet all this is in love and mercy, and but for a ſhort time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, and bring them from their ſins, and to wean their Hearts from the World, and to wind them up to himſelf by Repentance, and to draw their Hearts more eagerly after him, the Kingdom of God and Righteouſneſs; and as a tender hearted Father leaves not the Child altogether unpuniſhed, yet he corrects in meaſure, thus the Lords exerciſing his Peoples Faith, Patience, and Obedience, can never be ſaid to be their Diſcouragement, or contrary to any of his gracious promiſes to them in Scripture, but ſhould rather be atributed to that gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65284:121"/> of <hi>never leaving or forſaking of them,</hi> Jer. 30.11. chap. 31.18, 19, 20. Iſa. 43.2. And in his chaſtiſing of them, he diſtinguiſheth between them and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, it is the unhappy Lot of the Wicked, to be let run on in all manner of Ryot without puniſhment, and their Eyes to ſtand out with fatneſs, to be given over to their own Hearts Luſts, to their utter deſtruction, and to be given over to a reprobate ſenſe, and to take no pains upon them, but gives them leave to ſwallow down the Conſolation of their Luſts, with the bitter Pill of Eternal wo. Wo to you that are rich, for you have received your conſolation, wo unto you that are full, for ye ſhall be hungry; wo to you that laugh now, for ye ſhall weep; wo unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the falſe Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24, 25, 26. <hi>Job</hi> 21.30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The third Objection is, This Doctrine ſeems to be contrary to, and diſparageable of the Nature of God, who is holy, loving, juſt, and tender hearted, to ſuffer his own Children, who love, and ſerve him beſt, to be hampered with all the ill uſage of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, yea put to Death for his ſake, and amongſt men it would be great ingratitude for a Man to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Children and beſt Friends to be thus uſed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Lords ſuffering his Children to lye for ſome time under the ſmart of the Rod, can never be imputed to his want of tenderneſs for them; for as a Father can hear the complaints of a Diſobedient Child under correction, at the ſame time his Bowels of Compaſſion turn after him, and yet he Corrects, the Phyſitian loves and takes care of the Patient, though he will give him no Cordial until the Phyſick work, neither will the Chirurgeon take off the Plaiſters though they ſmart, until the wound be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65284:121"/> clean and whole; ſo the Lord ſuffereth the Rod of Afflictions to work up the ſinner to a Conviction, that the Cordials of his Love when reconciled, may be more accepted of, notwithſtanding in the mean time his Compaſſion faileth not; In all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pity be redeemed them, and bore them all the Days of Old, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.9.</p>
            <p>How ſhall I give thee up O <hi>Ephraim?</hi> how ſhall I deliver thee O <hi>Iſrael?</hi> how ſhall I make thee as <hi>Zad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma?</hi> how ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> my Heart is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, my repentings are kindled, <hi>Hoſ</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p>I have heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning himſelf thus, thou haſt chaſtiſed me and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock unaccuſtomed to the Yoak: is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpoke againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore, my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have mercy upon him nevertheleſs, I will correct thee in meaſure and not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The Lord cannot be counted unkind, much leſs ungrateful to his Children, when for a moment he chaſtiſeth them, and recompenſeth with eternal Salvation. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent Life which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared to the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, while we look not after theſe things which are ſeen, but after theſe things which are not ſeen; things which are ſeen are temporal, but things not ſeen Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 14.17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee, in a little wrath I hid
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65284:122"/> my ſelf from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy upon thee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 54.7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For his anger endureth but for a moment, in his favour is Life, weeping may endure for a Night but Joy cometh in the Morning,</hi> Pſal. 30.5.</p>
            <p>Thus then the Lord by his temporary Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot be ſaid unkind or ungrateful, to the beſt of Saints; when he exchangeth the momentany afflictions with Oceans of his goodneſs; <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, Conſider the Godly's ſtumbling at the Wickeds Proſperity; <hi>Ye have ſaid it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts, and now we call the Proud happy, and they that work Wickedneſs are ſet up, yea they that tempt God are even delivered?</hi> Mal. 3.14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> that Pattern of Wiſdom, Patience, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience gives alſo an account of the proſperous ſtate of the Wicked, and their arrogancy againſt God. And in the ſecond part he gives an account of their end; <hi>Job</hi> 21. to 16. thus, <hi>Their Candle is put out, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh on them, God diſtributeth on them ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in his anger, they are like the Chaff before the Wind, his Iniquities are ſtored up againſt his Children, his Eyes ſhall ſee his deſtruction, and he ſhall drink of the wrath of the Almighty, what pleaſure ſhall he have in his houſe when his Months are cut off in the midſt of them? the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is reſerved to the day of Deſtruction, they ſhall be he brought forth to the day of wrath,</hi> Job 21.16, to end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See the Iſſue of the Rich Glutton clothed in Purple and fairing daintily, and poor</hi> Lazarus <hi>begging the Crumbs at his gate, and the Dogs licking his Sores; remember that thou in thy Life, receivedeſt thy good things and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65284:122"/> Lazarus <hi>evil things, but now he is comforted and thou art tormented,</hi> Luke 16.19, to end.</p>
            <p>Hence we may clearly ſee Gods bounty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to his People, and well may they relye on his promiſes of rich rewards, for their Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſufferings for him. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that ye who have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man ſhall ſit in the Throne of his glory, ye ſhall alſo ſit on Twelve Thrones, Judging the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and every one that hath forſaken Houſes or Brethren, or Siſters, Father, Mother, or Children, or Lands for my ſake, ſhall receive one hundred-fold, and ſhall inherit everlaſting Life,</hi> Mat. 19.28, 29.</p>
            <p>The Godly may be perſecuted and ſuffer Death, but ſhall be happy in their Death; Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord, they ceaſe from their Labour and their Works follow them. And this is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, theſe are they which come out of great Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them, they hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, or any heat, for the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and lead them into living Fountains of Waters, and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Is not here a fair recompence for all poſſible tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, loſſes, croſſes and ſufferings? And on the other hand ſee the end of all the voluptuous pleaſures and enjoyments of the Wicked. If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the Cup of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65284:123"/> his Indignation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the Holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb, and the ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And they ſhall go forth and look on the Carcaſſes of men that have tranſgreſſed againſt me, for their worm ſhall not dye and their Fire ſhall not be quenched, and they ſhall be an abhorring to all fleſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2, 4.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand we have the further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Godly; Hear ye the Word of the Lord ye that tremble at his Word, your Brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my names ſake, ſaid, let the Lord be glorified; but he ſhall appear to your joy and they ſhall be aſhamed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5.</p>
            <p>And then ſhall the Godly ſee the accompliſhment of theſe evangelical Prophecies. My Servants ſhall ſing for joy of Heart, but ye ſhall cry for ſorrow of Heart, and howl for vexation of Spirit, and leave your name for a Curſe to my choſen, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.18, to 22. <hi>chap.</hi> 65.14, 15. and have all the other comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Promiſes and Prophecies made clear to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. all. <hi>chap.</hi> 60. <hi>chap.</hi> 61, <hi>chap.</hi> 62. <hi>chap.</hi> 63. <hi>chap.</hi> 65. <hi>chap.</hi> 66.</p>
            <p>As we have viewed mans ſtate from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and traced the ſteps of his toilſom Pilgrimage, to his reconciliation to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and placed him in the ſtate of Adoption by the Covenant of Peace, we come in the next place to conſider the difference of mans eſtate in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſure and happy condition in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator.</p>
            <p>Man in his firſt Creation while in obedience, was the Darling of God, Head and Lord of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on Earth, and had the priviledge of ſelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in all the Creatures, (under reſtriction of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65284:123"/> Command,) but luſting againſt the command and exceeding his bounds, broke the Chain of obedience and fell under the Curſe: and thus ſoon after his being made Lord over the Creatures, his concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ambition of enjoying more, and knowing more than what was allowed to him, by the Juſtice of God for his preſumption, he is deprived of his ſoveraignty over the other Creatures; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſubject to him, he and they alſo are ſubjected to the Curſe of Enmity; <hi>I will put enmity between thy Seed and her Seed, it ſhall bruiſe thy Head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe its Heel. Curſed be the Ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life,</hi> Gen. 3.14, to 20.</p>
            <p>Whereas upon the other hand, ſuch who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy to be within the new Covenant of Peace through Jeſus Chriſt, are founded upon ſurer terms of an everlaſting Covenant that cannot fail or be broken, and thoſe within it cannot miſs of having the priviledges and advantages thereof, and theſe principally are four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Covenant is everlaſting not ſubject to change or alteration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Faithful with whom it is made, and cannot fail in his performances.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As God who Covenants with his People, is faithful, able, and willing to perform on his part, ſo he fits his People to perform on their parts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The great benefit and advantages an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this Covenant eternal Life and all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This Covenant is everlaſting, how great a conſolation muſt it be to Believers, that they are not only reconciled to God, and the Curſe for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience taken off by Jeſus Chriſt in his blood, but alſo to be within an everlaſting Covenant with God, and have the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt to make conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65284:124"/> Interceſſion for them, for when we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength Chriſt in due time died for the ungodly, when we were yet Sinners Chriſt Died for us; much more being now juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him; if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled by his Death, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6.7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Wherein God willing more abundantly, to ſhew to the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath, by two Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, that we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us, wh ch hope we have, as an Anchor of the Soul both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the Vail, whether the fore-runner is for us entred, even Jeſus made an High Prieſt for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that by means of his Death, for Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, they which are called may receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal Inheritance, for Chriſt is not enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15, 25.</p>
            <p>If any Man ſin we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>The whole Scriptures are a ſeries of teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of this everlaſting Covenant with Believers. I will betroath thee unto me for ever in righteouſneſs, in judgment, in loving kindneſs and mercy: I even will betroath thee unto me in faithfulneſs and thou ſhalt know the Lord. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
            <p>This ſhall be my Covenant, not after the manner of their Fathers, but a new Covenant, and I will put
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65284:124"/> my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts and they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.31, to 38.</p>
            <p>They ſhall be my People and I will be their God, and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them and their Children after them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is faithful, therefore this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant founded upon his Promiſe cannot ſail, The gifts and calling of God are without Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. If my Covenant be not with Day and Night, and if I have not appointed the Ordinances of Heaven and Earth, then will I caſt away the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> my Servant, I will not take away any of his Seed to be Rulers over the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for I will cauſe their Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to return, and have mercy on them, Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but one Jot of my word ſhall not paſs away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.25, 26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third and main point in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are the qualifications given by God to man to perform this Covenant, for He it is that works all our works in us, in him we live move and have our Being, and without him we can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Theſe qualifications are principally Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Faith by the Apoſtle is defined, The Evidence of things not ſeen, the Subſtance of things hoped for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p>Faith by the ſame Apoſtle elſewhere is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: If thou wilt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and believe with thy Heart, that God hath raiſed him up from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, for with the Heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth. Man's confeſſion is made unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.</p>
            <p>So that Faith is the giving credit to the Word of God in all his Judgments, Threatnings, Promiſes, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65284:125"/> diſengaging our affections to ſin and luſts of the fleſh, and turning to God with all our Souls, Hearts, &amp; Minds, and reſting confidently and quietly on the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of what is promiſed, patiently waiting for the ſame, and this grace of Faith is accompliſhed, and wrought in the Hearts of his People by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; by Grace you are ſaved, not of Works, leſt any ſhould boaſt, but by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. and this Grace of Faith, hath he promiſed in his New Covenant; they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God, and I will give them one Heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and their Children after them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39. this qualification alſo hath he promiſed to give his People in that often mentioned Scripture, of the New Covenant, A New Heart, a New Spirit will I give them, I will take away the Stony Heart, and give you a Heart of Fleſh, and put my Spirit in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ways, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 26.25, to 29. of this grace and qualification of Faith, we have ſpoken el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewhere.</p>
            <p>The Second qualification to thoſe in this Covenant is Holineſs, for without Holineſs, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God: of this grace and qualification of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, we have ſpoken elſewhere.</p>
            <p>The Fourth excellency of this Covenant, are the many Advantages attending it, which may briefly be ſummed up in theſe four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To theſe within this Covenant belong an univerſal Inheritance of all things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The certainty of that Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The excellencies of the Companions of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The many Priviledges belonging to thoſe within this Covenant.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:65284:125"/>
            <p>Although the whole Scriptures are full of the great excellencies of the Heavenly Inheritance, and that place herein is verified, Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of Man to conceive (beſides thee O Lord) what he hath prepared, for thoſe that wait on him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 64.4. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.19. however they may be thus hinted at.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, it is an univerſal Inheritance, <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but freely gave him up for us all, how ſhall he not alſo with him, freely give us all things?</hi> Ro. 8.32.</p>
            <p>All Monarchs, Princes and Propriators of the Earth, have certain Confinements, and limits to their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories; and ſome enjoy, what others cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, either in reſpect of the extent of their Countrys, or Qualities or Wealth thereof; but none can pretend in the right of their Inheritance or Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, to that unlimitted Intereſt of fulneſs of right, that the Partners of this Covenant may; for in Chriſt Jeſus, all things are theirs, and <hi>they are Heirs of all things, and ſhall Inherit all things,</hi> Rev. 21.5, 6.</p>
            <p>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</p>
            <p>Let no Man glory in Man, all things are yours, whether <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> or the World, Life, or Death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. to 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Covenant is certain, all pretentions of right, or poſſeſſion of Earthly things, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and ambulatory, and in the experience of moſt, admit of their Eclipſe in this Life, witneſs <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Solomon, Haman, Mordecai, Herod,</hi> and all the great Heroes of this Life, who had their ebbings and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65284:126"/> flowings, and have not been exempted from the fate of changes, and with <hi>Solomon</hi> have found all but vanity and vexation of Spirit, and that often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, the 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. deſcribes the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and periſhing condition of the things of this Life, and doth aſcertain the Intereſt, and certain condition of the fellows of this New Covenant, as is more plainly expreſſed elſewhere; and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this Life, they leave a Man at beſt at his Grave, For we brought nothing into the World with us, and it is certain we ſhall carry nothing out, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 7, 17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third excellency of this New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is in the Company, Fellowſhip, and Society, the fellows of this Covenant have by vertue thereof, Men may have Honour, Wealth, and all other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Delicacies, and all this may be marred and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered to them, by the uneaſineſs, unſuitableneſs, and diſagreeableneſs of their Companions, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Society; but the Companions of this New Covenant are all deſirable, grateful, acceptable, and advantagious; the Soul of <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed by the wickedneſs of <hi>Sodom, Job</hi> in his Affliction was Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Wife, and heavily grieved by his three Friends, <hi>David</hi> Sojourned <hi>in Meſech, and dwelt in the Tents of</hi> Kedar, and this marred and leſſened their quiet, and deprived them of that content they could have had in more agreeable Society; but the Bleſſed Harmony of the Saints, increaſed the Comfort of all their Enjoyments, they are all ſo framed, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and adorned with Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Love and Unanimity, as they all mind the ſame things, and cannot jar or diſagree, and their joynt ſong is, <hi>Holy, Holy, Lord God of</hi> Sabaoths, <hi>the whole Earth is full of thy Praiſe; for through him, we both have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs by one Spirit unto the Father, now therefore ye are no more Strangers and Forraigners, but fellow Citizens
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65284:126"/> with the Saints, and the Houſe-hold of God, and are built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone, in whom all the Building fitly framed together, groweth into an Holy Temple in the Lord, in whom alſo ye are built together, for an Habitation of God through the Spirit, Eph.</hi> 2.18. to 23.</p>
            <p>See the Marks, Characters and Complexion of the Citizens of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> He that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, and diſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth his Ears from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood, that ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing of Evil, he ſhall dwell on high, his Habitation ſhall be the Munition of Rocks, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulation, which have waſhed their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, no unclean thing can enter there, without are Dogs and Swine, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.45.</p>
            <p>But we are come unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all things, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, and to the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things, than the Blood of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.22, to 25.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing relating to this State, are the Manifold Priviledges belonging unto them within it, which may be thus expreſſed,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They within this Covenant, are all Marked, Sealed and Recorded with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are under an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, in Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To them belong univerſal promiſes, both in Spirituals and Temporals, and under every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent.</p>
            <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65284:127"/>
            <p>Fourthly, All are united to God in Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are all Marked, Sealed, and Inrolled with God, as God Marked <hi>Cain,</hi> to keep him from Mans Fury and Rage, for the Murther of his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> when <hi>Cain</hi> was accurſed with Gods diſpleaſure, for that Horrid Villany; ſo God of his Love to the Saints, Marks them with his own Image, to keep them from the Deſtruction of Satan, and Inrolls them in the Book of Life, to be called by Name in the Reſurrection, <hi>Hurt not the Earth, nor the Sea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have Sealed the Servants of God in their Foreheads;</hi> Iſ. 4.3. Rev. 7.3.</p>
            <p>The Lord takes that care of his People, that as he commanded by the Paſs-over, the Door-Poſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be ſprinkled with Blood, as the ſign of his Peoples Habitation, ſo he puts his Mark of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Hearts of his own, to diſtinguiſh them from the wicked, who in their Converſation and Hearts, have Wickedneſs and Sin (the Mark of the Beaſt) and Worſhip his Image; he Writes on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Name of Righteouſneſs, and gives them for a Mark, <hi>The white Stone, and in it a New Name, Rev.</hi> 14.9. by which white Stone or Holineſs, they are Diſtinguiſhed from the Wicked in their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the New Name is a Badge of Honour, and ground of inward Conſolation to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond advantage of this State is, that they are under an everlaſting Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To this Covenant do belong univerſal promiſes, both in Spirituals and Temporals.</p>
            <p>The fourth and great Priviledge of this State, is that Myſtical and never enough admired Union of the Saints to God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us, that the World may believe, that thou haſt ſent me,</hi> Jo. 14.20. Ch. 17.21.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65284:127"/>
            <p>As Life Eternal is the reward of Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and as this Life Eternal is the great Prize at the end of our Chriſtian Race, and as we ought to uſe all Diligence, to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, there is no greater Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be imagined for our help in this, than the faith and due conſideration that Believers are my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically united to God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Although all the Creatures and Man eſpecially are parts of God, as coming out of the Maſs of Gods Omnipotence, yet Man is no Natural, or Phyſical part of God, ſo to ſpeak; Though Man be Gods by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Man in <hi>Adam</hi> having fallen from God by breach of the Divine Law given to him; God of his Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath provided a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and mean to reſtore and unite loſt man to himſelf, and this Union is by the renewing of Mans Nature, and changing it unto a Spiritual frame: When we were dead in ſins hath he quickned us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Chriſt. Now in Chriſt Jeſus ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the Blood of Jeſus, for he is our peace, who hath made both one, and broken down the middle Wall of Partition between us, having in his Fleſh aboliſhed the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Laws, Commandments contained in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for to make to himſelf of twain one new Man, ſo making peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 13, 14, 15. read all.</p>
            <p>Thus by grafting the Soul on Chriſt by Faith, is made a Spiritual Union with God, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all Spiritual Bleſſings, by a Heavenly Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from Chriſt, as the Graft receiveth Sap, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and made fruitful from the Stock into which it is grafted; this myſtical union of Believers between God and them conſiſts principally in theſe four.</p>
            <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65284:128"/>
            <p>Firſt, In Unity of Spirit with God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In unity of holineſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In unity of Love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In unity of Glory.</p>
            <p>Of all which Believers are partakers with God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To be one in Spirit, is to be one in Wiſdom, Knowledge and Purity of underſtanding, now <hi>God is a Spirit, and muſt be Worſhiped in Spirit and Truth,</hi> and though God made Man conſiſting of a Soul and Body, and did illuminate him with knowledge and underſtanding, though under a vail of reſtriction; and as ambition, and the concupiſence of his Heart, did deprive him of the advantage of his firſt ſtate, and the Wiſdom of God intending to reſtore Man, and place him in a ſurer Relation, to wit, (that everlaſting Covenant of Peace) through the vail of Chriſt's Croſs.</p>
            <p>He hath to the renewed beſtowed all Spiritual Light and Knowledge, yet becauſe we have this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſure in Earthy Veſſels, and the heavy clogs of our Carnal Bodies, and infirmities of the Fleſh, hinder mortals (even though renewed) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and apprehend theſe Heavenly excellencies, communicable under that Spiritual Union; and Chriſt intending to have the Saints made fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and capable of union with himſelf, he prays the Father that they may be one with the Father, as the Father and he is one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, that is to be of one Spirit, Wiſdom, and Underſtanding: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuppoſed that Chriſts intention is, that the Creature though firſt renewed, and afterwards glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, ſhould be elevated to that ſublimity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, equal with the Father and himſelf, but that their perfection ſhould be in kind nature, and purity
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65284:128"/> of God and Chriſts perfection, knowledge, and wiſdom, eſpecially in theſe three reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In purity of Spirit and Spiritual minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In oneneſs and union of mind and will.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In perfection of Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. So to underſtand things as they are, and not only under the dark ſhadows of humane appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Firſt of unity of Spirit. As God is a Spirit, pure, holy, and undefiled, and of purer Eyes than can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity, and that he muſt have all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and Citizens of that new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> like himſelf, and as Chriſts promiſe is, to prepare a place for his people, in that promiſe; Let not your Hearts be troubled, in my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, and I have prepared a place for you, <hi>John</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. And will have them with him, ſo will he have them to be like his Father and him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are holy: bleſſed are the pure in Spirit, for they ſhall ſee God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8.</p>
            <p>The natural Man is ſo cloyed with the liquoriſh reliſh of carnal things, that he cannot raiſe his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the true contemplation of the things of God, and therefore the Children of God muſt be made ſpiritually minded. The Natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him, neither indeed can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually deſcerned, but he that is Spiritual judgeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians are new Creatures, and with them old things are paſſed away, and all things become new, they are the Temple of God, God dwelleth in them, who can have no fellowſhip with the fleſh, therefore they muſt be ſpirituallized, for they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, but they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65284:129"/> that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. To be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually minded is Life and Peace, becauſe the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, ſo then they that are after the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Union of the Spirit is to be of one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to mind the ſame things as God and Chriſt did before the World began, they have and had one and the ſame purpoſe, intention, and mind, to do the ſame things; Peace and Unity of Spirit in Counſel and otherwiſe, is the greateſt Comfort and Strength of a Society, and this is the Harmony of Heaven; How doth <hi>David</hi> magnify this choice bleſſing? How pleaſant a thing is it for Brethren to dwell together in unity? it is like the precious ointment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even <hi>Aarons</hi> Beard, that went down to the Skirts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the Dew that Deſcended upon the Mountains of <hi>Zion,</hi> for there the Lord commanded the Bleſſing even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. all.</p>
            <p>The Lord is a Spirit of Meekneſs and Peace, and by Chriſts Doctrine the bleſſing is to the Meek: and his Command is to reſemble him in the Spirit of meekneſs; I am meek, humble, and lowly in mind, learn of me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. He unites all the Hearts of his People, to the unity of glorifying him, to have their ſhare of it in conſtant Hallelujah's: ſee Gods Promiſe to Chriſt; and the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt on him, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Spirit of Counſel and Might, and of the fear of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. to 10.</p>
            <p>O the admiration of Gods free love and goodneſs, to the Godly in their elevation to ſuch a ſtate of Glory, that he makes them all join in ſuch Elogies
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65284:129"/> of his praiſes, that they prompt one another to their perpetual ecchoings of his everlaſting glory, ſee what the Apoſtle adviſeth in this caſe. Keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, let the ſame mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, ye are all called to one hope in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. to 7.</p>
            <p>To be of the ſame mind with Chriſt Jeſus, is to have the ſame Will and Purpoſe which he had, as well in doing as in ſuffering, and to do and ſuffer to the ſame Ends and Purpoſes, for which he did or ſuffered any thing.</p>
            <p>Chriſt did and ſuffered all things by the joint ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and in obedience of his Father. The Father worketh hitherto and I work. Lo I come to do thy Will, in the volume of thy Book it is written of me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.</p>
            <p>In his ſufferings and acting in the myſtery of Man's Redemption, he did all by the reſolution of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father and Son did agree and join in the Spirit. God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Here the Father ſends, and the Son obeys and cometh, and both agree in one in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the matter of his Paſſion on the Croſs they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in one. <hi>Father if thou wilt let this cup paſs over, but not my Will but thy Will be done,</hi> Mat. 26.39, 42. The Fathers purpoſe was that Juſtice ſhould be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Death of the Son on the Croſs, and the Son humbly ſubmits. <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and yields up the Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 19.30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. And ſo in all the courſe of his Life, as well as at his Death, all his ſteps are ſquared according to the Will and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Father, as we ſee in the Hiſtory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
            <p>From hence in imitation of Chriſt are taught to us theſe two great Duties.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:65284:130"/>
            <p>Firſt, Submiſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A reſignation to the abſolute Will of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Submiſſion. In all Afflictions, Chaſtiſements, and Sufferings in all caſes, we are to exerciſe the duty of Submiſſion, <hi>My Son deſpiſe not thou the chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked,</hi> Heb. 12.5, to 12.</p>
            <p>Chearfulneſs without murmuring, and a Patient bearing up under every diſpenſation is the duty of ſubmiſſion, and with the Apoſtle to glory in the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt by whom the World is crucified to me and I to the World. And with the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a great Proficient in this learning of ſubmiſſion, I know how to want and how to abound, and in every condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12. And this ſhould be the courſe and care of all who reſolve to follow Chriſt Jeſus, to frame their mind and will under all diſpenſations to ſubmit and acquieſce to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>This was Holy <hi>Davids</hi> practice, under his ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and great affliction, when he had fled from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Son <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who had uſurped his Crown and when weeping, barefoot, and aſhes on his head, ſent back from him the Ark of God, the want of which was a great ingredient to his affliction. If I ſhall find favour in the Eyes of the Lord he will ſhew me both it and his Salvation, but if he ſay, I have no pleaſure in him, lo here I am, let him do to me what ſeemeth good in his ſight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26.</p>
            <p>He had the like ſubmiſſion, when he was reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, railed at, and had ſtones caſt at him, and was curſed by <hi>Shimei;</hi> Let him Curſe, for the Lord hath
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65284:130"/> ſaid to him, curſe <hi>David,</hi> who then ſhall ſay, why haſt thou done ſo? let him alone, for the Lord hath bid him, it may be that the Lord will look on my Affliction, and that the Lord will requite me good for his curſing this day, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, to 13.</p>
            <p>But what is all this to that entertainment the Lord of Glory Jeſus Chriſt met with on Earth for our Sins, who knew no ſin, who was buffeted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled after the moſt outragious manner, and bore it with incredible Courage, Patience and Meekneſs. Who when he was reviled reviled not again, when he ſuffered he threatned not, but committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, to 25.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>Stephen</hi> ſuffered with that meekneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he gave up the Ghoſt praying, Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them for they know not what they are doing, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59, 60.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Duty is reſignation, as ſubmiſſion is the patient acquieſcing to the Will of God in all his diſpenſations, without murmuring, and a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs in every condition, penury and want as well as in abundance, ſo reſignation is the chearful giving our ſelves up to God to be diſpoſed of by him in every diſpenſation, trials, troubles, loſſes and croſſes, under all the exigences of Life.</p>
            <p>Chriſt would not uſe the Arm of Fleſh to reſcue himſelf from being Crucified: but the Cup which the Father put in his hand, even the bitter Cup of his Fathers Wrath, he chearfully drank it out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was his Fathers Will, <hi>John</hi> 18.11.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> was a Pattern of Patience and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: though thou wouldſt ſlay me, yet will I truſt in thee.</p>
            <p>The Couragious three Children, who were not daunted with the Decree againſt them, their Faith, Courage and Reſolution brought them to a holy
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65284:131"/> reſignation; We know our God is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us, however, be it known to thee O King, that we will not ſerve thy Gods, nor worſhip the Image that thou haſt ſet up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhould Chriſtians in imitation of Chriſt, not ſo much mind their preſent ſufferings, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and condition, as the Duty of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, in giving themſelves up to the Will of God, in Obedience, Faith, and Patience, and for their encouragement in this, they have Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of deliverance from his own immediate hands, if other helps appointed by him ſhould fail: I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and there was none to help, I wondred that there was none to uphold, therefore mine own Arm brought Salvation unto me, and my right hand it upheld me, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16.</p>
            <p>That other famous place in the Prophecies of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> is a great ſtaff to Faith and Reſignation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſertion of all helps even lovers, relations and friends; all thy lovers have forſaken thee, they ſeek thee not, for I have wounded thee with the wound of an Enemy, with the Chaſtiſement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine Iniquities, becauſe thy ſins were increaſed, therefore all that devour thee ſhall be devoured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all thy Adverſaries ſhall go into Captivity, and they that ſpoil thee ſhall be a ſpoil, and all that Prey upon thee will I give for a Prey, for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore health unto thee, and heal thee of thy wounds, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14, to 18. and that other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place in <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 49.15. to end, giveth great encouragement to Faith and Reſignation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt extremities, as being forſaken of Friends, Relations, and much oppreſſed by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. All things which Chriſt did were holy and juſt, he minded only things of a Heavenly and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65284:131"/> Nature, as his Kingdom was not of this World, ſo all his people mind Heavenly things, they are Strangers and Pilgrims here in this World, and Travellers only with him to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and as Pilgrims muſt not ſet their Hearts on things in the Way, but on their Heavenly Treaſures. Lay up to your ſelves treaſure in Heaven, for where your Treaſure is there will your Hearts be alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, to 33. Love not the World nor the things of the World; if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him, for all that is in the World, the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, the Pride of Life, is not of the Father but of the World, and the World paſſeth away and the Luſts thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee, as Chriſt minded only Heavenly things, ſo he would raiſe his People to Heavenly mindedneſs, and by his deſcription of the World, his purpoſe is to wean his Peoples affections from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected, that this Doctrine of the Contempt of the World ſeems contrary to the Doctrine and Duty of Charity and Chriſts new Commandment, <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and love your Brethren as your ſelves,</hi> and that to Believers is alſo allowed the comfortable uſe of the Creatures, muſt not Parents love their Children, Husbands their Wives, and other Relations which in Scripture is commanded as a Duty, like as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Proviſion for Families, how can this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with the not loving of the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For anſwer to this, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is that wonderful Counſellor, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace, Wiſdom it ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. in whom dwells the Godhead bodily, love it ſelf, and Juſtice it ſelf, doth not teach inconſiſtent
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65284:132"/> Doctrines, neither that which is inconſiſtent with his Holy Nature of Juſtice, Wiſdom, Love, and Charity, but all his Doctrines are Coherent and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, therefore we muſt underſtand him in the Language of the Spirit,</p>
            <p>The World may be taken up two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and 31. And God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, and God reſted on the Seventh Day, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Sabbath, and left off working, and Abode not in the glory or beauty of his works, which were all good; but returned to himſelf, in that glory with his Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The World may be taken up, when for Mans ſin it was Accurſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. and was given into the Hands of the Dragon, and the Prince of the Power of the Air, was made Lord of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. Now in the firſt ſenſe to love the World as God did, when Man and all things were in Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to behold and enjoy the World, as God did reſting into himſelf, ſo admiring God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſting in the Creator; this loving and uſing the Creature or World, is not inconſiſtent with the love of God; but to uſe and delight in the Creature, when under the Curſe, Power and Dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and reſt on it, and not on God, is inconſiſtent with the love of the Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the words of the Evangeliſt, <hi>If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him: and by the Apoſtle</hi> James's <hi>Doctrine, know ye not, that the Friendſhip of the World is Enmity with God, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore will be a Friend to the World, is the Enemy of God, James</hi> 4.4. Theſe words muſt be meant in the ſecond Senſe, as when the World by <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion was accurſed, and as it were Eſcheated, and put in Bondage, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.20, 21. to Satan the Prince of the Power of Darkneſs: and not when it ſtood
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65284:132"/> ſtraight with God, and was all good in his Sight: and by theſe words, the Love of the Father is not in him, ſeems an Anathema, and Curſe to all the Lovers of the World, as the Apoſtle elſewhere pronounceth a Curſe, if <hi>any Man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Marenatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. ſo that the love of the World as it is under the Dominion of Satan in the ſecond Senſe, cannot be conſiſtent with the Love and Honour of God.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted, that the Father having giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Son for a Ranſom for Sinners, but with him alſo he will give them all things, and that they have in his right a ſurer and better Title to the World, and lawful uſe of the things thereof, than the Wicked can pretend to, for that the Godly are Heirs of all things, and the Wicked only Uſurpers of what they have in poſſeſſion without right; therefore by the Doctrine of Mortification, Holineſs, and Contempt of the World, they are not forbid, and not only permitted, but commanded a lawful Enjoyment of the Worlds good, but in theſe different reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they ſhall uſe the World, as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, that is, they ſhall uſe it as Pilgrims, for the preſent, ſober, and moderate ſubſiſtance, to carry them on in their Journeys Heaven-ward, and not to ſit down under the ſhadows of Worldly Pleaſures, as the wicked do, whoſe Portion it is, with a Curſe upon it to them, <hi>Wo to you that are Rich, for you have received your Conſolation, Luke</hi> 6.24. but the Godly are not to ſit down with the Rich Husbandman, to Solace their Souls only in the things of this Life, leſt with him they ſhare of his Judgment, <hi>Thou fool, this Night will I require thy Soul at thy Hand, then whoſe ſhall all theſe theſe things be which thou haſt?</hi> Luke 12.16, to 22.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Children of God do not, nor ſhould
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65284:133"/> rely only on the viſible Enjoyments of the Creature as capable of themſelves to give ſatisfaction, but on God by Faith, and on his Bleſſing to make them uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Mans Life conſiſteth not in the abundance of what a Man hath, Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God,</hi> Luke 4.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold the Lillies who take no care, and ſpin not, how they are Cloathed above</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Sow not, and yet are fed,</hi> Luke 12.22, <hi>to</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>All the Power of the Creation is in Gods Hands, as he hath the Power to reſtrain, and ſuſpend, or give a Bleſſing upon the Creatures, ſo hath he the Store-houſe of Heaven in his Hands, and he can ſend ſuch plenty, as there may not be room to ſtore it up in, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. See all the great and Manifold Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to his People in Poverty, Streights, and Wants, Iſ. 41.17, 18. Iſ. 45.3. <hi>I will give thee the Treaſures of Darkneſs, and the Hidden Riches of Secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The People of God do, and ought to uſe their Enjoyments vertuouſly, and do not ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them on unlawful Luſts, and Pleaſures, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately uſe them for their lawful and ſober Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or in Charity, and do uſe vertuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and improvements; but the Wicked feed their Luſts upon Gods bounty; wherefore the Lord in his Juſtice often Blaſts their Enjoyments, and either takes them away from them, or makes them a Curſe in the Enjoyment thereof, <hi>Ye Eat, and have not enough, becauſe ye ſpend on your Luſts,</hi> James 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>and in that other place, therefore I will return and take away my Corn in the time thereof, See</hi> Hoſea 2. <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People of God uſe all the Diſpenſations of God to them, in Sobriety, and vertuous Induſtry, and depend upon God for a Bleſſing to their Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but the Wicked live voluptuouſly in their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65284:133"/> Enjoyments, and do not principally aſcribe to God, the ſucceſs of their Husbandry, nor depend on him for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, in the Juſtice of God, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes from them what they have, or Blaſts their Enjoyments in the ſucceſs of it; ſee the Parrable of the ſluggiſh Servant, in miſ-improvement of the Talent, which was taken from him, and he puniſhed with utter Darkneſs; ſee Gods Judgment upon ſuch as do not truſt God with a Bleſſing upon their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Mat. 25. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt forgotten the God of thy Salvation, and not remembred the Rock of thy Strength, therefore ſhalt thou Plant pleaſant Plants, and ſet them with ſtrange Slips, in the Day ſhalt thou make thy Plant to grow, and in the Morning ſhalt thou make thy Seed to flouriſh; but the Harveſt ſhall be a heap in the Day of grief, and of deſperate Sorrow,</hi> Iſ. 17.10, 11.</p>
            <p>See that other Eminent place for this purpoſe, <hi>they Hatch Cockatrice Eggs, and weave the Spiders Webb; he that Eateth of their Eggs Dyeth, and that which is cruſhed, braketh out into a</hi> Vyper, <hi>their Webbs ſhall not become Garments, neither ſhall they cover themſelves with their Works, their Works are Works of Iniquity and Violence is in their Hands,</hi> Iſ 59.5, 6.</p>
            <p>See farther to this purpoſe, <hi>Ye ſhall Sow your Seed in vain, and your Enemies ſhall eat it, I will make your Heaven as Iron, and your Earth as Braſs, and your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vain, for your Land ſhall not yield her increaſe, neither ſhall the Trees of your Land yield their Fruit,</hi> Lev. 26.16, <hi>to</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſhall eat, and not have enough, they ſhall commit Whoredom, and not bring forth; becauſe they have left off to take heed to the Lord,</hi> See Job 8.11. <hi>to end.</hi> Hoſea 4.10.</p>
            <p>Conſider that further Judgment upon the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who truſt to the Fleſh, and not to God, <hi>ye have Sown much, and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough, ye drink, and are not ſatisfied, ye Cloath you, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65284:134"/> there is none warm, he that earneth Wages, earneth to put in in a bag that hath holes,</hi> Haggai 1. <hi>to</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>See the Manifold Judgments of God Denounced againſt Vanity, Pride, and Prodigality, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs, inſtead of a ſweet ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtench, and inſtead of a girdle there ſhall be a rent, and inſtead of well ſet Hair baldneſs, and inſtead of a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macher a girdle of Sackcloath, and burning inſtead of Beauty,</hi> Iſ. 3.16. <hi>to end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Wicked ſpend and uſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their own Pleaſures, and live in the delight of them, but the Godly are Dead to the World, and delight in nothing but in Chriſt, <hi>I am Crucified to the World, and the World to me, nevertheleſs I live, and yet not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, that loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
            <p>From hence and other Scriptures and Hiſtory of the Saints Lives, we ſee the different uſage of the Godly and Wicked, the Saints are Dead to the World, and their Delight and chief Satisfaction is in God, the Wicked make the World their God, and ſole Delight, and glut themſelves with Satiety in it; but the Godly can find no Contentment in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with Reference to God in Chriſt Jeſus, and make him their chief Delight, and cry out, <hi>none but Chriſt,</hi> and this is the Prohibition of the Goſpel, that we ſhould not love Father, Mother, Brothers, or Siſters, or our own Life more than God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37, 38, 39. but God doth not forbid the lawful uſe of the Creatures, but only forbids uſing it in Vanity, Superfluity, and Prodigality.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In being of the ſame Mind with Chriſt, is not only to Act, Do, and propoſe the ſame things with his Father, but alſo to do all, and ſuffer all for the Glory of God.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:65284:134"/>
            <p>The Worldlings kiſs their own Hand, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own Net, and ſay, their own Hand hath done it, and aſcribe the glory of all the Enjoyments they have to themſelves, or to the Creatures in which they delight, and ſay, <hi>Theſe are the Rewards which my Lovers and Companions have given me,</hi> Hoſea 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> aſcribed all to his own Power and Glory, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built for the Houſe of the Kingdom, by the Might of my Power, and for the Honour of my Majeſty?</hi> and ſee the Event, and Gods Juſt Judgment upon him, <hi>while the word was in his Mouth, there fell a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>to thee it is ſpoken, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is departed from thee, and they ſhall drive thee from Men, and thy dwelling ſhall be with the Beaſts of the Field, they ſhall make thee to eat Graſs as Oxen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times ſhall paſs over thee, until thou know that the moſt High Ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will,</hi> Dan. 4.30, <hi>to</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>See the Pride of <hi>Herod,</hi> and taking to himſelf the glory due to God, and the fatal Judgment of God on him for it, <hi>And immediately an Angel of God ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the glory, and was eaten of worms, and gave up the Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 12.21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand Chriſt ſet the Fathers glory before him, as the chief Scope and Deſign of all his Actions and Intentions: When his ſuppoſed Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and his Mother ſought him with Care, and came back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and found him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſputing, they told him they had anxiouſly ſought him, he anſwered not with Apology or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but ſaid, <hi>How is it that you ſought me, wiſt ye not, that I muſt be about my Fathers Buſineſs?</hi> Luke 2.46, <hi>to</hi> 50.</p>
            <p>We ſee that he placeth all his Buſineſs in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and doing of the Will of God, yea, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65284:135"/> his Eſteem on all ſuch, and accounts ſuch only to be his Relations, as obey his Fathers Will, <hi>And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to them, theſe are my Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Brethren, which hear the Word of God, and do it,</hi> Luke 8.21.</p>
            <p>We ſee in all the Miracles and Wonders Chriſt wrought Curing Diſeaſes, and Raiſing the Dead, he Exhorts to the giving of glory to God, and more particularly in that Famous place. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the Wiſe Man glory in his Wiſdom, nor the Rich Man glory in his Riches, neither let the Mighty Man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Might, but let him that glorieth, glory in this that he knoweth and underſtandeth me, that I am the Lord which exerciſeth loving Kindneſs, Judgment, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the Earth, for in theſe things I delight,</hi> Jer. 9.23, 24.</p>
            <p>Thus then ought all the Followers of Chriſt, to have the ſame mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus, that is to ſet Gods glory as the chief Scope of all Deſigns and Actions before them, <hi>He that gloryeth, let him glory in the Lord, and whatſoever we do, whether we Eat or Drink, let us do all things to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.31.</p>
            <p>The World was made by God, and for his Honour, therefore all ſhould be aſcribed to him, hence we may find, whether the ſame mind be in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, if we do what he did, and to the ſame end and glory of God, therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to bring all our Actions and Purpoſes to this Touch; for if they be not of this ſtamp, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated Counterfeit, and will not be allowed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, for all the Children of God are led by his Spirit, wherefore we muſt try the Spirits, whether the ſame mind be in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus; know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates, but ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the ſpirit of God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65284:135"/> in you; now if any Man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his; and if Chriſt be in you, the Body is Dead becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. becauſe of Righteouſneſs; but if the ſpirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your Mortal Bodies, by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you, <hi>Ro.</hi> 9.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Unity of Spirit is to be one in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is nothing raiſeth Mans thoughts more than deſire of Knowledge, and nothing Magnifieth Man more than Knowledge, and herein doth Man moſt excel all other Creatures, not only that God hath made them Lords over the Creatures, but that he hat endowed him with a Rational Soul, capable of underſtanding above other Creatures, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is the Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of God more eminent, than by the different meaſure of Knowledge beſtowed on Mankind; Man in general, exceeds all other Creatures in Knowledge and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, but every Generation and Nation exceed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at ſuch a Rate, ſo as what in one Age, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, is a Riddle, and hid as a Myſtery, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is Perſpicuous, clear and eaſie, ſo that the knowledge of things is the darling of Ages.</p>
            <p>Although we have the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the Fabrick of Heaven, Earth, and the Seas, the indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable and daily Travels of Diſcoverers, and the uſe of Reading, and the Antients to inform us, either of the parts of the Earth, and Treaſures thereof, yet are we ſtill to ſeek, as well of the Parts, as Treaſures of things undiſcovered.</p>
            <p>The New Inventions of Mens Ingenuity, or the ſecrets of Nature and Power of Art, make it true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, he that increaſeth in Knowledge, encreaſeth in Sorrow, becauſe the Soul of Man is reſtleſs, and the account of the Idolatry, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65284:136"/> and Rebellion of Man on Earth, is juſt cauſe of Sorrow, Grief, and Mourning, becauſe of the Diſhonour of God, and Deſtruction of Souls by ſin; nevertheleſs Knowledge is ſo choice a thing, that it makes ſome Men eminent in underſtanding, as much differ from others, as Man generally differs from a Bruit ſo that the Schools of underſtanding are both courted and deſirable.</p>
            <p>Now if the knowledge of the things of this World, be ſo deſirable and excellent, how much more is the knowledge of God, things of God, and Eternal Excellency, which Nature cannot Fathom? and tho' we had all the Books Written, and attained to all Human Learning, and had all the Hoſt of Heaven, and Creation under the Sun to inſtruct us, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by can we not be inſtructed, or learn the Myſtery of Mans Redemption, or know Regeneration and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, or power of God in the ſpirit, much leſs be able to find out the Eternal purpoſe of God, to the ſouls of Believers, or to apprehend that fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of glory, that Believers are intituled unto, and ſhall enjoy. Eternally in Heaven, wherefore if we muſt be Wiſe to eternal Life, we muſt be Fools to this World, for according to <hi>Solomon, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 1.7. <hi>So that if any Man lack Wiſdom, he muſt ask it of God, who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth not,</hi> James 1.5.</p>
            <p>If the Excellency and Advantage of knowing the periſhing ſhadows of Earthly things, lead Mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſo much after that, much more may we be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſeek after the knowledge of God, and of ſpiritual things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that in Human knowledge, there is no perfection, we ſee in all Ages, Countries and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one Generation exceedeth the other in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience, and in one and the ſame Age,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65284:136"/> one Man far exceeds another, in ſo much that the Wiſdom of one, is ridiculed by the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All Human knowledge leaves a Man in this life, yea, a Man often ſo Declines in his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, that his own Life is his Burden, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Child or Bruit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Mans knowledge is his Burden, becauſe he can attain no ſatisfaction thereby, it having no end or perfection, ſo as all his Life is Anxiety, Trouble and Sorrow, Witneſs <hi>Solomon, Ecl.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. all. <hi>Ecl.</hi> 12.12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The knowledge of Human things puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up, and driveth a Man often ſo above his level, that many Learned in Diſcontent, have run into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and ſtrangled themſelves; but the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowledge of God and ſpiritual things, have the quite contrary qualities and effects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Divine knowledge is ſo choice a thing, that the more a Man hath of it, he becometh the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, abaſeth himſelf, and adores God the more, therefore have I uttered that I underſtood not, I have heard of thee by the Ear, but now mine Eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.3, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Human knowledge is a Burden, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge is a Delight, becauſe the more a Man knoweth, he humbleth himſelf the more in ſenſe of his own Vanity, and is confirmed in his knowledge, becauſe by Divine Wiſdom, he ſees all the ſteps Coherent, and tend to his building up in God, and ſo delights in that knowledge, <hi>then ſhall we know if we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Hoſea 6.3. here is Aſſurance of Attainment, which is not in Human knowledge, witneſs ſuch who ſpend their Time, Life and Subſtance, in purſuing after that phanciful Foppery, commonly called the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65284:137"/> Stone) who for moſt part dye fools or beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if not both.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. As the knowledge of Human things fail and leave a Man in this Life &amp; the knowledge of God and ſpirituals attend a Man here to his Grave, and grows and Conducts him, not only to his Grave, but alſo to Heaven, <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſed are the Dead that Dye in the Lord, they ceaſe from their Labour, and their Works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13.</p>
            <p>Their knowledge of God in Faith is their Guide and Comfort, Chriſt hath promiſed to ſend to his People for their Guide, and Comfort the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, Even the Spirit of Truth, which the World receiveth not; becauſe it knoweth him not, but ye know him, and he dwelleth in you, and ſhall be in you; I will not leave you, I will come to you, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the knowledge of Human things is imperfect, and therefore Mens burden, and the cauſe of ſuch Imperfection may be,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods Wiſdom to keep Man from boaſting of himſelf, ſo it may be from the changeableneſs of Human Objects, in reference to times and ſeaſons, and alſo from providential Influence, on the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative part, making it more acute in one Age, than in another, to ſhew the abſolute Dependance of all Creatures on the Influence of Providence, as ſhall beſt pleaſe God, ſo the Wiſdom and Knowledge, which is from above, and diſpenſed to Chriſtians on this ſide of time, is alſo clouded and narrow, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and but in part, not that the Wiſdom of God can be dark, but the manifeſtation thereof may be ſo ſaid to be, in relation to that full fruition after enjoyed, for that either Wiſdom which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. all. Thought fit to let out no more of himſelf to Believers, then might be neceſſary to the Diſcovery of Carnal and Sinful Vanities, and be a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65284:137"/> guide to lead them to Heaven, in longing Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after the more Glorious knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Or Secondly, For that our Crazy and Earthy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, as old brittle Bottles, were uncapable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch inexpreſſible Communications of himſelf, and theſe Eternal Manſions of Felicity, which are Treaſured up in Chriſt Jeſus for the Saints, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he allows them no more here, than is fit with Comfort to waft them in upon Eternity, and then for the further Manifeſtation of his own glory, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wiſdom, doth exchange our Mortal and vile Bodies of Duſt, not able to receive ſuch glory, into immortal Bodies, and then doth manifeſt himſelf to the full to the Saints, who then ſhall ſee, not in a ſhadow only, but plainly as they are ſeen, that their glory may be full; for we know but in part, and propheſie but in part but when that which is perfect is come, than that which is in part ſhall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for now we ſee through a glaſs, darkly, but then face to face, now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as I am known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 9 to 13. and this is that Myſtical Union of the Spirit, by which the Saints are made one with God in Chriſt Jeſus, in that inexpreſſible knowledge and ſight of God, whereby they ſhall be able to ſtand in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, face to face, and behold his glory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it.</p>
            <p>The Second Branch of Union with God is Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God is eſſentially Holy, and Holineſs it ſelf, [whoſe Name is Holy] <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.45. and can as well be divided from himſelf, as from Holineſs; ſo who are one with God, muſt be Holy, and to be Holy, is to be partakers of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Chriſt the only begotten Son of God, and expreſs Image of his Perſon, whoſe Errand to the World was, only to Reconcile God to Man, knowing how
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65284:138"/> Eſſential Holineſs was to the Bargain, he and all the Prophets and Apoſtles Preach up Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is the chief piece of the Saints Armour, to fight the Battels of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.14. and is that Image of Chriſt, to which Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be Conformed to, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.24. and <hi>Colo.</hi> 3.10. and by which they are diſtinguiſhed and known.</p>
            <p>Holineſs is that Cloathing of the Saints, who ſit with God on his Throne in his Kingdom, theſe are the White Robes waſhed in the Blood of the Lamb, and the Brides Wedding Garment, ſpoken of in the Goſpel, for the clean Linnen is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But to this it may be Objected, that Chriſt is made to us of God, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Salvation, and Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. ſo we need take no care for inherent Holineſs in our ſelves, but may ſit down and reſt on his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs, and Rely on his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which may be anſwered thus, That it is moſt certain that Chriſt is Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to Believers, and that they are Cloathed with his imputed Righteouſneſs, in the Eyes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of God, and by his Stripes they are healed, and all that Saints could do, would never make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for Tranſgreſſion, and although Chriſt by his Death, hath moſt ſufficiently ſatisfied Juſtice for our Offences, and that thereby the Father in him is well pleaſed, nevertheleſs, as he hath promiſed to Reconcile us to the Father, and hath actually Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled ſuch as believe in him, and hath to them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Eternal Salvation by his Blood, and having procured for them Heavenly Manſions, to make them Companions with himſelf, and his Father, Angels
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65284:138"/> and Saints, there is a neceſſity for an Inherent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, with which they muſt be cloathed as that Wedding Garment, and attire ſuitable to the Bride, in ſuch Heavenly Manſions, where no unclean thing can enter in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. and this cloathing and garment is the renewing the Children of God in their Nature, all things are made new, old things are done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>We muſt forſake and crucify the World, we muſt dye to ſin and live to righteouſneſs, we muſt be planted in his Death, that we may live in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. to 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10, to 14.</p>
            <p>We muſt put on the Nature of Chriſt in Spiritual Holineſs, Circumciſed without hands, putting off the Body of Sin, and are quickned with Chriſt by his effectual working of Grace. The Affections muſt be above the Creatures, and the new Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Knowledge after the Image of him who created him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. The Saints live no more to the Fleſh, but are dead to it and live by Faith, I am crucified to the World and the World to me, nevertheleſs I live, but not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me, and the Life that I live in the Fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt, in whom the World is crucified to me, and I to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p>Thus then inherent Righteouſneſs, and holineſs of the Saints, is that which qualifieth the Soul for union with God in Chriſt Jeſus, and this holineſs though inherent to the perſons of all Saints, is not their own growth or product, but is the gift of, and ſpecial working of the Spirit of God, he it is alone that gives the new Heart, and creates in them a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65284:139"/> clean Spirit, and takes from them the Heart of Stone, and ſits them for this union.</p>
            <p>The Third branch of Saints Union with God, is their being one with him and Chriſt in love. I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one, and that the World may know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me, before the World began, <hi>John</hi> 17.23.</p>
            <p>Love in its perfection is the Darling of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues and Graces, and is ſuch eſſential part of Holineſs and Divine Nature, that it cannot be without it, as God is Holineſs. Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, ſo is he love it ſelf; Let us love one another for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God, and he that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7, 8, 16.</p>
            <p>Love is Chriſts chief command, and from his own example, a new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, as I have loved you, by this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another, <hi>John.</hi> 13.34, 35.</p>
            <p>Love as the Character and Mark of a Chriſtian, is not only a naked and bare profeſſion of kindneſs and friendſhip, but conſiſts in theſe two:</p>
            <p>Firſt, In a firm and conſtant ſympathy of, and with any, in any afflicted ſtate or condition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In a conſtant, chearful, and ready ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the wants of others, as far as their abilities will reach.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This love conſiſts in a conſtant and tender ſympathy in all troubles, afflictions, and diſtreſſes, in Body, Spirit, or Eſtate, like as Chriſt was; In all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them, in his love, and in his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65284:139"/> pity he redeemed them, and bore them all the days of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9.</p>
            <p>There is denounced a ſevere curſe and wo againſt ſuch as are at eaſe, and unconcerned in the caſe of Gods afflicted People. Wo to them that are at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and forget the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Amos 6. to 7. Charity and Sympathy either to the Church of God in general, or to any of the particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or Saints, is the great badge ornament and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 3, to 7. Love is to be in amity and unity, and not in contention one with another love thy Brother as thy ſelf. But, if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould conſider the height, depth, and full extent of Gods love towards them, which is a myſtery paſſing knowledge, that we may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians in one anothers afflictions, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate themſelves in that holy cement of love, or mutual ſympathy and aſſiſtance, to comfort, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, aſſiſt and relieve one another, under their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral afflictions: ſee the woful character of ſuch as do not relieve and love his Brother; If a Man ſay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, the love of God is not in him, he is a Liar, for he loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, and how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. And this command have we from him, that he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, loveth his Brother alſo, and he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Brother is a Murtherer, and no Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath Eternal Life abiding in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond branch of Divine Love, approved of God to make up the Union of the Saints with God, is that laving out the Bowels of charitable aſſiſtance, in the ſupply of the Saints ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, like the good Samaritan in the Goſpel,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65284:140"/> not only to ſee and pity his affliction and condition, but to ſupport it: God is not only a bare Spectator of our miſery and maladies, but alſo a healer of all our wounds, and is that only Phyſitian of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and hath, and applies that balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> even the Balſom of his own Blood to cure us; hereby know we the love of God for us, becauſe he laid down his Life for us, and we ought to lay down our life for the Brethren, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. But whoſo hath this Worlds good, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of compaſſion from him, how doth the love of God dwell in him? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. If God ſo loved us we ought alſo ſo to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Greater Love hath no man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for a Friend, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13, to 18. The Duty of Chriſtian charity is recommended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as the evidence of Chriſtian ſincerity. The bleſſing is to the liberal, the liberal Soul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered himſelf, <hi>Pr.</hi> 11, 24, 25, 26. See the exhortation from Chriſts own example. But ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that tho' he was Rich yet for your ſakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that ye through his Poverty might be Rich: and that famous exhortation, conſider them that are in bonds as being bound with them, and ſuch as are in adverſity, as being your ſelves in the Body, <hi>Hebrews.</hi> 13.3.</p>
            <p>See how the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> challengeth a naked beholder of the poor, naked and indigent; If a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Siſter be naked and deſtitute of daily food, and one of you ſay, depart in Peace, and be you warmed and filled, notwithſtanding ye give them not theſe things which are needful, what doth it profit? <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16. So that it is not bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which makes Love, but the fulfilling of the Commandment, love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, as Chriſt loved his Church and laid down his Life for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65284:140"/> her, ſo ought we alſo for whom Chriſt died. Hence we ſee how great is the Priviledge of Believers for whom Chriſt both died and is riſen again, and taken poſſeſſion of Heaven for them, and that the Father will love them with the ſame love, with which he loved his only Son, before the World was, ſo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould not be affraid, for Love admits no fear; There is no fear in Love, for perfect love caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fear, becauſe fear hath torment, he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is not made perfect in Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.18.</p>
            <p>What quiet and comfort therefore may Believers have, who find that love of God conſtraining them to wait on him by Faith, may with <hi>David</hi> ſay, we will not fear what man can do unto us, and with the Apoſtle, if God be with us who can be againſt us? be of good courage for God will ſtrengthen your Hearts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the Saints are one with God and Chriſt. 1. In Spirit. 2. In Holineſs. 3. In Love. So 4. In Glory, which is the higheſt priviledge ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and is clearly held out in the Text; And the glory thou haſt given me, I have given them, that they may be One even as we are One. Father I will that they alſo which thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which thou haſt given me, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 24. And as God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son to dye for Sinners, ſo Chriſt continues his Love, that he will have all for whom he died, to ſhare of the ſame glory with himſelf, and this is the higheſt exaltation and expectation of the Saints, contrived by the Wiſdom of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and his being ſet down at the right hand of Glory for us.</p>
            <p>This ſuperexcellent ſtate of the Saints Glory, and Eternal Happineſs; is branched out in a fivefold
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65284:141"/> conſideration. Firſt, In their bleſſed Death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Their Spiritual and Immortal Bodies. Thirdly, Their being admitted into the Preſence of God and Hoſt of Heaven. Fourthly, Their being continued in that ſtate for ever. Fifthly, All Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Tears and Mourning to be everlaſtingly done away.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Man in his firſt Creation was made Lord of all Creatures; and tho' after his Fall, by the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and infinite Love of Jeſus Chriſt, was reconciled to God by a new Covenant of Peace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs was continued in a Priſon of Clay, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected not only to all Natural weakneſs, ſickneſs, cold, hunger, thirſt, and other natural infirmities of the Fleſh, and uneaſineſs of Life; but alſo while in the body, obnoxious to the Temptations of Sin, and grief of Soul, through the weakneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, under the clog and coverture of the Fleſh, as the experience of all Men Witneſs, that this Life is but Labour and Sorrow; therefore the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and love of Chriſt Jeſus, hath ſo contrived that the Soul (a Priſoner) to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and infirmities, ſhould have the Chains of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality knocked off by Death, and be let free to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And this is the firſt ſtep of Saints effectual Happineſs. The Holy Apoſtle clearly teſtifieth, that whilſt we are in the Body we are abſent from the Lord, and therefore not only we but the whole Creation groan under theſe Infirmities, and long for the Liberty of the Sons of God, even the Redemption of our Bodies: and therefore it's revealed that Death is as it were the opening of the Priſon Door, to the Priſoners of Hope, to ſet them at liberty from all the miſeries of Mortality and Temptations to ſin, and gives them a free Paſs to the Land of Reſt. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead thy dye in the Lord, they ceaſe from their Labours and their Works follow them.</hi> Rev. 14.13. And this is a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65284:141"/> great Conſolation to Believers, for as Death is the end of all Fleſhly pleaſures, it's alſo the end of all ſin and Miſery, ſo the way of Death and the Grave ought not to be loathſom or irkſom to them, for that Chriſt the Captain of our Salvation hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both ways, and for us led Captivity Captive, O Death where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy Victory? and the laſt Enemy is Death, who is led Captive by Jeſus Chriſt, he will ſwallow up Death into Victory, he will Ranſom them from the power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death. O Death, I will be thy plague, O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction, Repentance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14.</p>
            <p>The Second inſtance of Eternal Happineſs, is to have Spiritual Bodies. The glory of Heaven and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, which is Eternal Happineſs, being deſigned for the Saints, therefore the Lord in his Eternal Wiſdom, hath contrived and fitted them for it; for as Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, nor Corruption Incorruption, ſo the Lord doth provide his Saints Spiritual and Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Bodies, capable to receive theſe Spiritual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of his Glory, and of Chriſt, and all the Heavenly Hoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. read all.</p>
            <p>As this is an Eminent Inſtance of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Believers ſhall be Cloathed with Spiritual Bodies, like that of Chriſts, ſo it may Miniſter great Conſolation to Afflicted Miſers, that the time doth not only haſten, in which they ſhall be delivered from Miſery, but that alſo they ſhall have Bodies incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any miſery.</p>
            <p>The third Eminent inſtance of this Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is to be admitted into the Fellowſhip of Chriſt, and all the Heavenly Hoſt, that they may be with me, where I am, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.24. It is uſual to Strangers to inquire into all the Magnificence of all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65284:142"/> Countries where they Travel, the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to ſee the glory of <hi>Solomon, Hezekiah</hi> ſhewed to the Ambaſſadour of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> all his Glory, Power, and Wealth, but what's all the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, but Poppet ſhows, to the glory of God, which is above Human reach? and as the greateſt Honour Kings can give their Subjects, is to admit them into their preſence, and conſtant Fellowſhip, ſo this is the Chief Dignity of Saints, that they are admitted into the immidiate preſence of God and Chriſt, and that not under a Cloud or Vail of the Fleſh, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw God in the Mount, and as the Lord appeared in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and at the Door of the Tabernacle, but face to face, to behold the fulneſs of his glory; for when we are under the Clog of theſe Earthly Bodies, we cannot behold the Majeſty of God, but when we are Clothed with theſe immortal Bodies, we ſhall ſee as We are ſeen, and know as we are known, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 11, 12. And as the glory of God himſelf is ſufficient for all admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Satisfaction, ſo the ſight of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hoſt of Heaven cannot but be exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, to ſee the ſufferers for Chriſt, enjoy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their Patience and Faith; to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, will I grant to ſit down with me on my Throne, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my Father on his Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes in the Blood of the Lamb, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him Day and Night in his Temple, and he that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the Throne, ſhall dwell amongſt them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.14, 15. This is the patience of the Saints, theſe are they that keep the Commandments, and the Faith of Jeſus, theſe ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes, Rev.</hi> 14.4, 12, 13. Theſe are the Souls of thoſe who were beheaded for the Name of Jeſus and the Word of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65284:142"/> 3, 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. Theſe are they which were invited, and prepared for the Wedding of the Lamb. See the Apoſtles Deſcription of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Society, but ye are come unto Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the City of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to an innumerable Company of Angels, to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of Sprinkling, which ſpeaketh better things, than the Blood of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24.</p>

            <p>The greateſt favourites have fallen, <hi>Haman</hi> was Hanged, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> Hang'd himſelf, becauſe his Court fell, but the Favour of God is for ever, he that abideth in the Will of God, ſhall indure for ever, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.17. his People are all Sealed and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they are made Pillars of the Temple of God; have his Name on them, and can go out no more, they are before the Lord Day and Night, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. and dwells with him, they are Heirs of all things, and can never fall from the Favour of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7.</p>

            <p>Inference, Though Man by Nature in the above Deſcription, be inexpreſſibly Miſerable, yet not without Remedy by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, who dyed for a ſinner, and Salvation and Eternal Life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Believers in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7. <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. wherefore we ſhould take Heart, Courage, and a patient waiting on him.

            <p>Firſt, Under the deep Senſe of Mans Miſery in the condition of Natural ſin, as in the preceding Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Man with a continual Lowlineſs and Humility of Mind, as a check to Pride, Self, and Sin, looking into Mans Character, when any thing of Sin or Temptation offers, and with the Apoſtle cry out, O Wretched Man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from this Body of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Have deep Admiration of the height and depth of the unſearchable Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, who hath made Chriſt to Believers all and in all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be Reconciled to the Croſs of Chriſt and Affliction, as the happy means of Reconciling thee to God; before I was Afflicted, I went aſtray, but now have I learned to know the Law: I will return to my place, and hide my Face, until they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Iniquities, ſeek my Face, in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they will ſeek me early, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. I have refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee, but not with Silver, I have choſen thee in the Furnace of Affliction, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 48.10. I will bring her into the Wilderneſs, and there I will allure her, and ſpeak Comfortably unto her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. I reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the preſent Afflictions of this Life, which are but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65284:144"/> to that exceeding weight of glory, that ſhall be revealed in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ly patiently under the Rod, until the time of thy Deliverance come, and quarrel not with the Inſtruments of thy Chaſtiſement, hear the Voice of the Rod, and who hath appointed, wait for the Viſion, though it tarry it will ſpeak, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. Say with <hi>David,</hi> Lo here am I, let him do with me, what ſeemeth good in his ſight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25, 26. as with the Apoſtle, I have learned in every condition therewith be content. I know how to want, and how to abound, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, until he plead my Cauſe, and Execute Judgment for me, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Believe it to be a Truth, and be Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, that all things work together for good, to ſuch as wait for him, and that the end is Eternal Life in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.28.</p>
            <p>Faith and Salvation are inſeparable Companions, as well from the Covenant of God in Chriſt Jeſus, as from the Fidelity, Power, Promiſe, and good Will of God, and this alone is able to anſwer all the Cavils of Malice, and Diſquiet, or Diſcouragement; which may ariſe from the Conſideration of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery by Nature, or under the ſenſe of Mans weakneſs under his ſinful Condition; in this, that he that believeth, ſhall have Eternal Life, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. for though Man in his beſt Condition by Nature without grace, be a meer Picture, Shadow, Vapour, Bubble, and like a Bell upon the Water, or dew on the Graſs that withereth, his whole Life Labour, and Sorrow, Vanity, and lighter than Vanity, ſo as he deſireth Death rather than Life, and at Death is the end of all his glory, and his Miſery is endleſs, in Everlaſting Deſtruction, as in the foregoing Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hence is the unſpeakable Conſolation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that the Covenant of God is everlaſting, not
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65284:145"/> of the things of this Life only, but alſo of the Life t come, the gifts and calling of God are without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and herein doth the excellency of the Covenant of grace exceed that of the Covenant of Works, with Man in his firſt Creation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The firſt ſtate and Condition of Man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered, was of the things of this Natural Life only; but the New and ſecond Covenant, is of things of this Life. and alſo of that which is to come, ſo that the New Covenant which hath the promiſe of this Life, and of that alſo which is to come, is more valuable than the other: <hi>Godlineſs is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore Chriſt adviſeth us not to ſtore up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing things, but rather the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19 to 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſee in Natural Mans Deſcription, what a ſlippery thing he is, and the meanneſs of his Condition, and where all with him ends; but the Enjoyments of the New Covenant, is the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all things which periſh not, nor change, <hi>Ro.</hi> 11.29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To this New Covenant belong Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which make Happineſs here, and Eternally hereafter, by all which the Fellows of this Covenant are endowed with the greateſt priviledges, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with the Richeſt promiſes that infinite Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, thought fit to make a happy State here, and Eternally hereafter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The excellency of this Covenant is ſuch, that the priviledges thereto belonging, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and ſecures the Heirs of this Covenant againſt all viciſſitudes in this Life, and fits and moulds them for the Enjoyment of that Eternal State, provided and ſecured by this New Covenant, the infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, deſigning to make Believers, Citizens of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> made without Hands,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65284:145"/> eternal in the Heavens; alters and changes the whole frame of Man from what it was formerly in Nature, and ſquares him to that Heavenly build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Although of Gods free Will and Pleaſure for his own glory, without the neceſſity of any further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Man was at firſt Created by God, &amp; as the free love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, is the only Riſe of Mans Eternal Happineſs; nevertheleſs it is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by Election, but alſo by Regeneration, and newneſs of Life in Chriſt Jeſus; and by being made Holy, as God is Holy, and therefore the whole frame of the elect, as well of Soul as Body, is changed into the likeneſs of Chriſt in Spirit and Body, If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature, all things are made New, and old things are done away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 17.</p>
            <p>That you put off the Old Man which is corrupt according to the Deceitful Luſts, and that you put on the New Man, which after God is Created in Righteouſneſs and True Holineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>That ſuch faſhioning and change muſt be before the Elect can fully be admitted into the preſence of God, and enjoy him unchangeably, may appear by theſe reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, for that the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, intending to compleat Mans Happineſs, and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Miſtery of his love, by their immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelf in the Spiritual, Clear, and full preſence of glory, <hi>That they may be one with me, ſee me, and behold my glory,</hi> Jo. 17.24.</p>
            <p>The Communication of Gods glory being ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limely ſpiritual, and not apprehendible, but by theſe who are purely ſpiritual, therefore our dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding muſt be made ſpiritual, The Natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65284:146"/> neither indeed can do, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, but he that is ſpiritual, judgeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. and therefore in order to compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints Happineſs, and to frame them for that, he promiſeth to put his ſpirit in them, and give them a New Heart, and renew a right ſpirit in them, ſo as they may ſuitably enjoy God, <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Divine Wiſdom knowing how Earthly mindedneſs runs after the Creature, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therewith, is clog'd from thirſting after God, and things ſpiritual; to be Carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded, is Life and Peace, for that they who are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, but they who are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit, becauſe the Carnal mind is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, <hi>Ro.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>And therefore to wean their Hearts from the World, and to wind up the Affections of the elect to himſelf, it behoveth their frame to be made ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, The Lord Jeſus Chriſt gives this as his Command to his Diſciples, to be ſpiritually minded, and to mind Heavenly Treaſures which are not Corruptible, and uſeth this Argument, for where your Treaſure is, there will your Hearts be alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord Jeſus making his People of a Heavenly and Spiritual frame, chiefly to mind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Spiritual things, ſets their Affections more earneſtly on himſelf, diſengages them to Human Enjoyments, Reconciles them to Afflictions, and makes them more eaſie under the Croſs. If in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> experience, that all the World is but Labour and Sorrow, and Death is more to be deſired than Life, how much more eaſier will the Affections of the renewed be under all Diſappointments of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, when with the Apoſtle, they look to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65284:146"/> and the inſeparable and everlaſting Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, will they not count all things but Dung and Loſs in Compare with the Excellencies of Chriſt? <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.18. For I reckon that the ſufferings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, are not worthy to be compared to the glory which ſhall be revealed in us. And in that other Famous Scripture, for our Light Afflictions, which are but for a Moment, work for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and an Eternal weight of glory, whilſt we look not after things which are ſeen, but after things which are not ſeen, for things which are ſeen are Temporal, but things which are not ſeen, Eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee how great is the goodneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God towards renewed Mortals, intreating them with ſo great Mercy and Love, in convincing them of the vanity of Earthly ſhadows, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to them, that ſo High, Deep, Long; and Broad Miſtery of Love in Chriſt Jeſus, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge, and the Riches of the glory of that Miſtery, which is Chriſt the hope of all glory, made manifeſt in the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.26, 27.</p>
            <p>And by their choice of theſe excellencies above the Creatures, to make all things elſe, to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of no value, and in their Souls deſire, to Eccho <hi>forth none but Chriſt,</hi> and having ſo ſpiritualized their minds, that they can neither Touch, Handle, Smell, or delight in any thing but him, and what tends to his glory, and their Enjoyment of him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the framing of the Saints Bodies at the Reſurrection, in a Spiritual and Incorruptible Body, for Chriſts deſigning not only Mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from wrath to come, but alſo to make them Coheirs, and participate with him of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>John</hi> 17.22.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65284:147"/>
            <p>And in reſpect, the frame of our Carnal and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Bodies, is not capable to receive that glory, nor to continue under the Enjoyment of it, for that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of glory, nor Corruption inherit Incorruption, he therefore changeth that Corruption into Incorruption, and makes Mortality put on Immortality, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our vile Bodies into the faſhion of his glorious Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, to 55. according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Phi.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>What then can or will be wanting, to compleat the Eternal Happineſs of the Saints, ſeeing they have ſo ſure a Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ant, with ſuch ample Priviledges, and that they are, and ſhall be fitted as well in Body, as Soul, to receive theſe Rivers of Pleaſures, in the Enjoyment of God, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe Right Hand, there are pleaſures for ever-more, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.11.</p>
            <p>What then remains for the Priſoners of Hope, but to ſit down &amp; admire the Heighth, Depth, Length and Breadth of that Incomprehenſible Miſtery of the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 18, 19. and by Faith, Love, and Patience, to ſit down under his ſhadow with great Delight, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2. and againſt all Croſſes, Temptations, and Difficulties to take Comfort in the Faith of Eternal Happineſs, there is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit, if God be for us, who can be againſt us, who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Juſtifieth, who is he that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, it is Chriſt that Dyed; yea, rather that is riſen again? who is even at the right Hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us; who ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of Chriſt? I am perſwaded that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65284:147"/> nor Powers, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, we ſee Believers firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated to the Title of Joynt Heirs of glory with Jeſus Chriſt, and in a firm Covenant through him with the Father, and having ſo fair an intereſt at ſtake, their Duty is to purſue the ſame with Faith, Courage, and Patience, and their great prize is not to be had, but by a continued warfare, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is taken by violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee in the foregoing Doctrine of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Saints Examples, and Chriſts Doctrine of Mortification, Reſignation, and patient bearing of the Croſs, that the Chriſtians Life is a continued war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; through Tribulation and Perſecution, ye muſt enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more incumbent or neceſſary to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, than chearfulneſs, the chearful Champion gives glory to the cauſe, and aſſiſts the fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers expectation of Victory, quickneth Actions, and the glory of Victory hoped for makes Combatants diſpiſe all Difficulties; if then in common Warfare, which is only for Worldly Honour, Riches, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt (which when obtained) periſh in the uſing, the chearfulneſs be requiſite, much more in the War for Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>In this warfare the Combatants have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than any others. Firſt, For that the prize fought for is eternal happineſs. Secondly, The Victory they fight for, is that which Chriſt hath already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for them, to wit, their Eternal Salvation, and Deſtruction of Death and the Devil; <hi>Chriſt is crowned with glory and honour, he brings many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons to glory, and makes the Captain of our Salvation, perfect by Sufferings, who by Death deſtroyeth him that hath the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65284:148"/> power of Death even the Devil, and delivers them who for fear of Death, were all their Life time ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and is the faithful High-Prieſt reconciling people to God; and having ſuffered being tempted is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them who are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.9, to end.</p>
            <p>If in the common caſe of War, Courage and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs be a neceſſary duty, much more in this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian warfare for theſe three reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſtians of all Warriours, have the moſt excellent priviledges, promiſes, and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is Chriſts honour to fight chearfully, under his Banner, in imitation of himſelf, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Saints.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They have Chriſts Command for chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fighting. In all Warfare theſe three things are to be conſidered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether the War be offenſive or defenſive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The cauſe of the War.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Means, Proviſions, and Allies, to Proſecute and Defend the War.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Chriſtians War, is both Offenſive and Defenſive.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Defenſive: The melancholy recital of the Annals of Mans Creation and firſt Eſtate, and how he fell from the Original Righteouſneſs he was Created in, and that afterward enmity was ſowed between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, and a continual warfare, ſo as <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhall bruiſe Mans Heel, and Man the Serpents Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. demonſtrates to us that here is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare denounced from enmity never to be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Man being loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> of Gods Free Will, Chriſt the Mediator of the new Covenant is early promiſed; this is the Covenant of Grace; <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved, and not of works, ye are Sons and Heirs of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Promiſe,</hi> Eph. 1.4, 5, 6, 7. chap. 2.5.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:65284:148"/>
            <p>Hence ariſeth this inteſtine War between the Creatures, the Seed of the Woman, which are the Heirs of this Covenant and Elect in Chriſt, and the Seed of the old Enemy the Devil, which in all Ages are of the World, and Emiſſaries of Satan to <hi>Perſecute the Woman and her Child, and ſpew forth floods of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution on the Godly,</hi> Rev. 12. to 11.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee how this continued War is laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of the World: It appearing that Mans Enemy is the Devil, his Emiſſaries the World, and the Fleſh, who are no inconſiderable Enemies. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers, againſt Spiritual wickedneſſes in High Places, againſt the Rulers of Darkneſs of this World,</hi> Eph. 6.12. This Enemy elſewhere is called the Prince of the Power of the Air, and is cloathed with all miſchievous qualifications to fight.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is cloathed with ſubtilty and lying, by which at firſt he deceived <hi>Eve,</hi> and by the Apoſtle his Temptations are called, <hi>Wiles of the Devil,</hi> Eph. 6.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is powerful, <hi>He is the Prince of the Power of the Air, that ruleth in the Children of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is reſtleſs and vigilant, <hi>going about night and day, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, His Malice is unplacable, ſee how he purſueth <hi>Job</hi> from time to time, with falſe inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God againſt him, <hi>Job</hi> 1. to 12. <hi>ch.</hi> 2. to 7.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, His Courage and Boldneſs is undaunted he dare tempt the Lord of Glory with impudently renewed Temptations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. to 10.</p>
            <p>He purſueth the Woman and Child Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, and ſpeweth forth great floods of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution to deſtroy them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. to 11.</p>
            <p>He fights againſt the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.</p>
            <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65284:149"/>
            <p>This warfare is both defenſive and offenſive.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Defenſive: In all Wars the Defenſive is moſt favourable, nothing being more juſt and natural than to defend ones own right, intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and in the Chriſtians caſe moſt juſtifyable and neceſſary, for Satan the firſt old and continued E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Mankind, having firſt invaded mans quiet and felicity, and tempted him, to break Covenant with God, and continually envying Mans better eſtate in the new Covenant reſts not to aſſault him, and endeavour to ruine him a ſecond time, <hi>As he that was born after the Fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4, 29. So it is now, and this enmity of bruiſing mans Heel is put upon him as a Judgment for tempting, and upon man as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his yielding to the lying and treacherous inſinuations under the cunning and ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Mans advantage, that Man ſhould know more, and better; but his malicious intention was to ruine Man with God Eternally.</p>
            <p>Have Chriſtians then ſo powerful an Enemy, cunning, malicious and vigilant, who is always on his Poſt to deſtroy, and have they ſo conſiderable an Intereſt at Stake, how doth it then behove them to <hi>ſtand faſt to the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free, and not to be weary in well doing, for if we faint not, we ſhall reap in due ſeaſon?</hi> Gal. 5.1. chap. 6.9.</p>
            <p>Is any thing more worth conteſting for, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of defence, than that great advantage of being redeemed from wrath to come, and title of honour to ſit on the Throne of Chriſt, and be heirs of all things, which is not given to the lazy, but to the diligent and victorious. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to ſit on my Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.12, 21. We muſt not ſlumber but be vigilant; <hi>Ye are the Children of Light and of the Day, not of the Night and Darkneſs,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65284:149"/> therefore let us not ſleep as do others, watch therefore putting on the whole Armour of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This War is offenſive, All Wars though at firſt but defenſive, turn for the moſt part to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, for that injuries may be ſo done by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that provoke the attacked to become an agreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, not only for reparation, and ſatisfaction, but upon ſucceſs in defence to invade the firſt agreſſor, to confine him to ſuch limits, as he may not for the future, be capable of doing further injury; and thus of neceſſity it muſt be in the Chriſtian Warfare, againſt Satan, the World and the Fleſh, ſo that this War is founded upon ſuch implacable enmity, that it muſt be continued without hope or expectation of any peace, end, or terms of accommodation, for theſe three reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Soveraigns of this War are of Intereſts incompatible, ſo that of neceſſity the victory muſt turn to one ſide, before the War can be ended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Parties and Combatants are under different and incompatible Laws, ſo can never be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All terms of Treaty or Capitulation, are by command forbid in this War.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Soveraigns of this War are of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible Intereſt, and therefore the War muſt be perpetual until one of the Parties be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the Generaliſſimo of the Chriſtians Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Satan the Mammon of this World, the Fleſh and Luſts thereof makes up the competition; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible then muſt it be, with the right glory, honour and intereſt; of Chriſt, who in his own right is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> to ſuffer a Rival to his Inheritance: though for his wiſe ends, he let Satan looſe for a while, to tempt and ſift the Nations, and draw the Children of Darkneſs into ſnares and diſtruction, and to try the Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65284:150"/> of Gods own People in which the wicked Men are Gods ſervants and inſtruments; however, to ſuffer their power to prevail, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconſiſtent with the abſolute power, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of Jeſus Chriſt, and although Satan and his Emiſſaries have fought many Battels againſt Chriſt and his Church, they have ſtill been overcome in all of them, and ſhall be overcome until Chriſt bring Judgment into Victory and overcome him, who hath the power of Death, even the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. to 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 17.14. Oh Death I will be thy Plagues, O Grave, I will be thy Deſtruction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. Death is ſwallowed up into Victory; O Death where is thy ſting O Grave where is thy Victory, the Sting of Death is Sin, and the ſtrength of Sin is the Law, but thanks be to God who hath given us the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, to 56.</p>
            <p>The Lord of Life hath told us, we cannot ſerve God and Mammon, we muſt reject the one, if we ſerve the other, ſo that their Intereſt being inconſiſtent we muſt onely be of one ſide, there is no fellowſhip between God and Belial: So that they cannot divide Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, therefore there is a neceſſity to be on Chriſts ſide; The Son of the Bond Woman which is Sin and Satan, the World and Luſts thereof cannot Inherit with the Son of the Free Woman, which is Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Combatants of theſe two Armies, have different and inconſiſtent Laws, and theſe Laws are ſo relative and in ſuch affinity, with the ſeveral intereſts of the Soveraigns, that of neceſſity perpetuates the War, ſo as no end can be expected, except by abſolute victory of one or other ſide.</p>
            <p>All Chriſts Soldiers are new Creatures, renewed in the Spirit of their Mind, have the ſame Mind in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65284:150"/> them which was in Chriſt Jeſus, are under Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Holy Laws, ſubject to his Will according to that Portion of his Spirit, which he hath given them, ſpiritually not carnally minded, walk and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of the Spirit, and not of the Law of the Fleſh; they are not led with <hi>malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, envyings, ſlanderings, back-bitings, murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and cruelties, which are the works of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 4.19, 20, 21. But they are led after the Laws of the Spirit, and live in all <hi>gentleneſs, meekneſs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, charity, and kindneſs, as the works of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 4.19. Epheſ. 4.22, to end. Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, theſe under Antichriſts Banner, neither are nor can be ſubject to the Laws of the Spirit, for they are of the Fleſh, and live after the Fleſh; <hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be Spiritually minded is Life and Peace, becauſe the carnal Mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, ſo that they which are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Fleſh Luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary one to the other,</hi> Gal. 5.17. So we ſee that the Laws of theſe pretenders to Dominion are ſo oppoſite to one another, that it is impoſſible to reconcile them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third thing which perpetuates this War, is that no treaty, capitulation, or agreement, can be between theſe parties, this enmity is ſo laid by God himſelf, that Satan muſt bruiſe Mans Heel, and the Seed of the Woman muſt bruiſe Satans Head, to the end of the World; Such enmity is between God and Mammon, that the love of the one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the ſervice of the other. <hi>Know ye not that the Friendſhip of this World is enmity to God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore will be a Friend to the World is the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. <hi>Love not the World nor the things
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65284:151"/> of the World, if any man love the World the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15.</p>
            <p>Thus the Intereſts and Laws of theſe two parties, being ſo inconſiſtent, there is no Room for any treaty, hopes or poſſibility of accommodation; for that the Spiritual Man, hath antipathy to the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Carnal Man cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of holineſs, becauſe of the enmity of his mind; and therefore the holy Apoſtle is ſo far from accommodating the matter, between Luſt and Holineſs, Fleſh and the Spirit, that he would not have the Spiritual Man to keep any Communication with the unfruitful works of Darkneſs; <hi>What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath God with</hi> Belial, <hi>a clean thing with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; who can touch pitch and not be defiled therewith? evil communication corrupts good manners;</hi> Wherefore he forbids all tampering with the ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the World or Earthly things. <hi>Wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the World, why as though living in the World are ye ſubject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? taſte not, touch not, handle not theſe things, all which periſh in the uſing, after the Doctrine and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men,</hi> Col. 2.20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in another place is more ſevere, where he commends the Repentance not to be repented of, and in the effects of ſorrow and repentance he ſaith, <hi>Behold this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a Godly manner, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your ſelves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement deſire, yea what revenge, yea what zeal?</hi> 2 Cor. 7.11. In which we ſee what expreſſions of vehement zeal againſt corruption and ſin, which are the works of the Fleſh, by theſe expreſſions, vehement deſire, indignation and revenge is implied, ſuch implacable diſpoſition, that nothing can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy except a total ruine and exterpation of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65284:151"/> and their adherents in root and branch, and thus it muſt be with Chriſtians, they muſt not be Neuters, or luke-warm, but muſt be mortified to the fleſh and the Body of Death, Corruption and Sin muſt be ſo ſubdued in them that they muſt be Dead to the World, and the World to them, ſo as they can take no more pleaſure therein, than the living can have in the Dead, with which they can have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. <hi>I am Crucified to the World; and the World to me, nevertheleſs I live, but not I; and the life that I live in the Fleſh, is by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. chap. 5.24.</p>
            <p>Hence we ſee all the Combatants <hi>of Chriſt</hi> are wholly his, and not divided, and can by no means Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley with the Enemies of his Croſs, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, and this is their indiſpenſable and commanded duty, that they muſt fight till they overcome, for to ſuch alone is the prize of Eternal Life; <hi>He that overcometh ſhall ſit with me in my Fathers Kingdom, even as I overcame and am ſet down with my Father in his Kingdom,</hi> Rev. 3.21.</p>
            <p>They muſt live to the Spirit, and not to the Fleſh, with that holy fear over themſelves, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Eye on the Enemies Camp, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt Sin and the Fleſh, that they <hi>may not again return to their folly,</hi> and that they may place no Earthly thing in their Hearts above Chriſt, and all the days of their appointed time they muſt wait till their change come.</p>
            <p>As this Chriſtian warfare is continuing, and muſt only end with our lives, we are to conſider for our encouragement, that Chriſt doth not leave Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans unprovided for ſuch great expedients, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides them a great Train of Artillery, as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of their warfare, which is held forth to us in that deſcription of the Armour of the Spirit by the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65284:152"/> Apoſtle, put on the whole Armour of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eph. 6.13, to 19.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Loyns girt with Truth; which is inward ſincerity and conſtant loyalty to the Cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Breaſt-Plate of Righteouſneſs, to be blameleſs and of upright converſation towards God, and to avoid ſcandal to the wicked, and be an example of Juſtice and Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Feet ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace, to be peaceable, charitable, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and meek, and conformable to the Laws of the Spirit, and not of the Fleſh.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Shield of Faith, believing God in his Attributes of Omnipotency, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs, and in Jeſus Chriſt as the Saviour of the World, in all his Promiſes and Providences, by which we may be able to reſiſt the fiery Darts of Satan, in anſwering all objections of unbelief and diſcouragements from Temptations in the World.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Helmet of Salvation; to believe that Eternal Life is the prize, at the end of the Chriſtian race, and this is cure againſt all Trials, from want, or difficulties, in the Way to Heaven, to be as aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Eternal Life, as we are cloathed with that Helmet of Defence; <hi>It is Chriſt that died who ſhall condemn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Praying and Watching as good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, on their Poſts waiting for the word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to march at all times after the General and Captain of our Salvation Jeſus Chriſt, and to be ready with Oyl in our Veſſels, and Lamps burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, waiting for the approach of the Bridegroom, to enter into the Marriage feaſt of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Thus ſeeing this War is conſtant, and for the greateſt prize, even Eternal Life, and though againſt the moſt Potent Enemies, Principalities, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65284:152"/> Wickedneſſes, in High Places, yet Chriſt the unconquerable Champion is Captain, and the Camp is furniſhed with ſuch compleat warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, Chriſtians ought to fight chearfully, for theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Salvation and Eternal Happineſs is the prize contended for.</p>
            <p>And we have Chriſts Promiſe if we fight in Faith, and continue to the end, we ſhall obtain it, <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we are to fight and contend for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, ſo it is not only promiſed to us on our chearful fighting, but it is alſo obtained for us by Chriſt, who on the Croſs fought that good fight, and freely gives us the booty, and prize, when we were not capable to do any thing for our ſelves, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly, God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt died for us; much more then being now juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him,</hi> Rom. 5.6, 8, 9. Ezek. 16. to 9.</p>
            <p>This is that great bait for ambition and deſire, this is that all, which ſhould ſwell the Thoughts and Affections of all Men.</p>
            <p>This rightly conſidered is ſufficient to invite all Courage, Patience, and new Obedience; to fill all Hearts with Joy, gladneſs, and thankſgiving, and ſtifle all murmurings, repinings and diſcontents un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trials or difficulties of worldly concerns, and in our Way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>This ſhould induce all to a hearty ſubmiſſion to the yoak and chearful fighting under Chriſts Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Theſe Combatants of Chriſt have the greateſt booty, rewards and priviledges that any Soldiers can pretend unto, and that both of Spirituals and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65284:153"/> Temporals, and thoſe Spirituals are in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are under an everlaſting Covenant with God, and God with them, I will make with them an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.27, 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.20, 21. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They have remiſſion of all ſins, though of the higheſt and blackeſt Nature, though never ſo numerous, and as a Cloud or a thick Cloud, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>ch.</hi> 44.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They have comfort in Spiritual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deſertion, their caſe can never be ſo cloudy, melancholly, and dark to them, but Gods word hath a promiſe for it, <hi>Light is ſowen to the righteous, and joy to the upright in Heart,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. Mal. 3.12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are Heirs of all things, and ſhall inherit all things, they have the Promiſe of the things of this Life, and of that which is to come, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They ſhall be united to God in Chriſt, in Spirit, Knowledge and Glory, and be inſeparable from him in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, to 25.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They ſhall be ſet down with Chriſt and God in Glory, and continue with them for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 38, 39. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. Thus we ſee the unqueſtionable Spiritual advantages of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which no other Intereſt can bring, and as the Saints advantages and excellencies are Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible as to Spirituals, ſo the ſecurity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are no leſs in Temporals, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this Treatiſe diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In general,</p>
            <p>Secondly, His Promiſes in all particular caſes, As</p>
            <p>Firſt, In Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Poverty.</p>
            <pb n="281" facs="tcp:65284:153"/>
            <p>Fourthly, Under the unkindneſs and forſaking of Friends.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Under reproaches.</p>
            <p>This great promiſe of general and particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and ſo many great priviledges being the firſt ground of Chriſtian encouragement.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That they have the example of Chriſt, his Prophets and Saints in Heaven, who have with undaunted courage, chearfulneſs, and patience, fought that good fight and have received their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>As it is great happineſs in any warfare to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wiſe, able and experienced Commanders, and as the fame of the Captain raiſeth Courage and hope of Victory, ſo it is much more in this Chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, where Chriſt is General and the Saints in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are examples.</p>
            <p>Whoſe Courage, Wiſdom, or Power, can be comparable to Chriſts, who is Wiſdom it ſelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20. <hi>chap.</hi> 8.1. who is power infinite, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. and for his experience he is the antient of days.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is Wiſdom it ſelf, wiſdom is his ſtile and name, and well it may be ſo, for by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</p>
            <p>Firſt, He made all things, and by himſelf he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things; <hi>He is the Image of the Inviſible God, and in whom dwelleth all Power and the Godhead bodily,</hi> Heb. 1. to 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is infinite in Power, and <hi>there is no ſearching of his underſtanding, he hath meaſured the Waters in the hollow of his hand, he metted out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his Span, and comprehended the Duſt of the Earth in a Meaſure, and weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance, The Nations are before him as a drop of a Bucket; and are counted as the ſmall Duſt of a Ballance, he taketh up the Hills as a very little thing,</hi> Job 32.8. ch. 38. ch. 39. Iſa. 40.12, to 16.</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:65284:154"/>
            <p>Thirdly, For Experience, he is the Antient of days, the Firſt-Born of every Creature, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga:</hi> ſee that Diſcription given him by <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wiſeſt of Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>He is not only Wiſe, and Wiſdom himſelf, but he is Wiſdom diffuſive to others, gives them not only the precepts of Wiſdom, but doth infuſe Wiſdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and maketh them docile and quick in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and in this he exceeds all other Captains and Teachers, who may inſtruct, but cannot form the underſtanding, as he doth, <hi>I will pour my Spirit on you, I will make known my words unto you,</hi> Pro. 1.23. John. 1. to 6. Iſa. 61.1. He is the Spirit of Wiſdom, inlightning the World, he is ſent of the Father, and hath of him received the Spirit, to Communicate Wiſdom to others.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Almighty giveth him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this Wiſdom is ſuch as excelleth, becauſe it is of Chriſts own Spirit, Pure Truth, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pure as Gold, yea, purer than much fine Gold: ſee the excellent vertue of Gods Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Converting the Soul, Enlightning the eyes, Clean, True, Righteous, Sweet, Inſtructing, and in keeping of them there, is great reward, and endure for ever, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.7, to 1.</p>
            <p>This Wiſdom is the fear of God, from whence it hath its riſe, and how excellent and deſirous this is, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. and all <hi>ch.</hi> 8. all, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. in which are made out all advantages, both Spiritual and Temporal.</p>
            <p>See what account the Holy Prophet makes of this Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, above all Human Knowledge, or of things Earthly; let not the Rich Man glory in his Riches, nor the Wiſe Man in his Wiſdom, nor the Strong Man in his Strength, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, ſaith the Lord, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65284:154"/> he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exerciſeth loving kindneſs, Judgment and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p>The Holy Evangeliſt teſtifieth of this Wiſdom, <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Jo. 17.23, 24.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtle alſo declares, what this Wiſdom is, even Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who of God is made unto us Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond qualification of this great Chriſtian General in his power, joyned with what is already ſaid, he is infinite in power, He is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14. he is the Bleſſed and only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. He is the moſt High, and ruleth in the Kingdom of the Earth, and giveth them to whomſoever he pleaſeth; of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17, 25. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33.</p>
            <p>He poureth Contempt on Princes, and cauſeth them to wander in the Wilderneſs, where there is no way, yet ſetteth he the poor on High, and maketh him Families like a Flock, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 107.40, 41.</p>
            <p>He can make Nations as ſtubble, and Kings of the Earth as nothing, he makes waſt Mountains and Hills, and dryeth up all the Rivers; he can make Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Iſlands, and dry upon the Pools; he can lead the Blind, the way they know not, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42.15, 16.</p>
            <p>He can make Darkneſs Light, and Crooked things Straight, he can form Light, and Create Darkneſs, he can make Peace, and Create War, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third quality of this great General, is his great Experience, Conduct and Valour.</p>
            <p>Can the Antient of Days, who hath Conquered and Subdued all he ever Encountered with, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Victory on his ſide? had not he the better of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65284:155"/> Old Enemy the Devil, who beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and for his lying and preſumption, Condemned him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Enmity and Contempt?</p>
            <p>Did he not Conquer <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Pride and ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Plagues, and overthrow him wholly at laſt?</p>
            <p>Did he not ſignalize his Power, Fame, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in Deſtroying their Enemies, and appearing for them in all the Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their afflicted Conditions, ſee the great Series of his Care of them.</p>
            <p>Did not he overthrow the Devil, when under Temptation of Hunger, and would not work a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle for his own Relief; but Preached up Faith, on the Word and Power of God? <hi>Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God,</hi> Mat. 4.2.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Did not he when Tempted from Scripture, to truſt to Gods Protection, in throwing of himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, reject that Inſinuation of Satan by Scripture, <hi>Thou muſt not Tempt the Lord thy God, Pſ.</hi> 71.11. By which he Magnified the Soveraignty of God, and would not Tempt Providence? <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And being Tempted to Worſhip the Devil, for the gain of the World, he defeated the Tempter from the Duty of Worſhipping God only, <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. 4.9, 10.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, by his Submiſſion to the purpoſe, and Will of God on the Croſs, he overcame Death, the laſt Enemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.50. <hi>ch.</hi> 28.60. and by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Crowned Mans Eternal Happineſs, <hi>O Death I will be thy Plague, O Grave, I will be thy Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Repentance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes,</hi> Hoſea 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Hence is this Admirable Inſtance of the Power, of that Champion of our Salvation, who through the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65284:155"/> vail of his own Fleſh, hath made Conqueſt of Eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal Life for us, and by his free Love, Power, and good Will, hath given them the Victory over all his Enemies, and the laſt Enemy, Death it ſelf, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Sin the Sting of Death, and as the great Trophy of his Victory, hath <hi>Blotted out the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinances, which was againſt them, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, and Nailed it to his own Croſs, and ſo hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Victory for Believers,</hi> Col. 3.13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>From hence may be ſeen, the Truth of that great Miſtery of Gods Love in Chriſt Jeſus, Eye hath not ſeen, neither hath Ear heard, <hi>&amp;c. Iſ.</hi> 64.4. and how great Reaſon then have ſinful Mortals to be much in the Admiration of all the Dimentions of that inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Miſtery of Chriſts Love, which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>
            <p>As the many Advantages from the Booty, in this Conflict, and Chriſts Example, is an inducement for chearful fighting, ſo is the Example of the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Companions of this Combate, of which ſee a great Tribe of the Royal Combatants under this Banner of Chriſt, fighting to Death with Immortal Glory, ſet down before: the Saints Banner, is the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing, ſave in the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p>In this Croſs or Banner, Chriſt carries in it, as the Trophy of his Victory and Motto, for the Comfort of Sinners, that Hand-Writing of Ordinance above mentioned, and this is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of Believers, Col. 2.14. <hi>He that Believeth on him, ſhall never periſh, but have Eternal Life,</hi> John 3.14, to 18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third Encouragement for chearful fighting, is Chriſts expreſs Will and Command, <hi>Let not your Hearts be Troubled, you believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> &amp;c. Jo. 14. <hi>to</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rejoyce always, yea I ſay, rejoyce evermore,</hi> Col. 3.16, 17.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:65284:156"/>
            <p>The whole Scripture is full of Exhortations of the Godly's Rejoycing in God; Let the Hearts of them that ſeek the Lord, rejoyce, again rejoyce in the Lord always, I ſay again rejoyce in the Lord, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 105. all, <hi>Phi.</hi> 4.4. the Combatants under Chriſts Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, have peculiar Reaſons of chearfulneſs beyond all others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that their General was never defeated, neither can be, for how is it poſſible that Wiſdom, Power, and Experience, which Chriſt is in himſelf, can be Defeated?</p>
            <p>Secondly, All other Souldiers fight in Hopes of Victory, here the Victory is inſured, and already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, Chriſt hath already fought the Battel, and Chriſtians are but to follow chearfully, and receive the Prize, <hi>He hath trod the Wine-preſs of his Fathers Wrath, and none of the People were with him;</hi> Iſ. 63. <hi>to</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>He is that only High Prieſt and Sacrifice for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and is the Blood of Sprinkling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16.</p>
            <p>He is our Fore-runner and Harbinger, to take poſſeſſion for us within the Vail, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20.</p>
            <p>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27.</p>
            <p>He is offered up once for all, <hi>By his own Blood, he obtained Redemption for Sinners, to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> Heb. 12.27.</p>
            <p>He is our Advocate, to make interceſſion for us, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All the Soldiers Wounded in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, are Healed and Cured by the Balſom of his Blood, He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities, the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are Healed, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.5.</p>
            <p>O Miſtical Balm of <hi>Gilead!</hi> doth any Generals Blood, prove the Soldiers Balſom, but that of Jeſus Chriſt?
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65284:156"/> the lives of Millions of Soldiers are Sacrificed to the Life of their General, but this General dyed, to ſave the Lives of his Soldiers, <hi>God commendeth his Love towards us, for while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt dyed for us,</hi> Ro. 4 25. Ro. 5.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thoſe who fight under this Banner, ſhall never be overcome, even though they fight to Death they may be troubled but not deſtroyed, perplexed but not in deſpair, perſecuted but not forſaken, caſt down but not deſtroyed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10. They may be killed all the day long, and counted as Sheep for the Slaughter, and yet in all this, be more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44.22. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.36, 37.</p>
            <p>He hath ſo Framed, Fitted, Faſhioned, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them in a ſpiritual Building and Frame, by putting his invincible Spirit in them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.26, 27. and ſo Armed, and Diſciplined them in a Spiritual Warfare, that they are invincible; they have on the whole Compleat Armor of God, that though their fighting be againſt Principalities and Powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places, they are ſecured againſt all aſſaults, enabled to fight all Battels, and though they ſhould and muſt reſiſt unto Blood, and in this fight loſe their Carnal Life, yet ſhall they be gainers, and victorious, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12, to 19.</p>
            <p>He that ſaveth his Life, ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth his Life, ſhall find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29.</p>
            <p>He that raiſeth up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe us up, and preſent us with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>Fear not him that can kill the Body, and do no more, but fear him that can deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Chriſt's Soldiers are not ſtraglers, but are all choſen of God, from the beginning of the World, and before the World was, <hi>Romans</hi> 9.8, 11, 16. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.29, 30.</p>
            <p>They are all Named, Marked, Liſted, and Entred
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65284:157"/> in Chriſts Muſter-Roll of his Saints, they have the Mark of God, <hi>The White Stone, and New Name, and on them, the Name of God, and the Name of the City of God,</hi> Rev. 7.3. ch. 14.14. ch. 2.7. ch. 3.8, 12. ſo that they cannot be loſt, ſtolen, or forced from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, having Gods Name and Mark on them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 8.4, 5.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They are all given of God, to the General, Chriſt Jeſus, and I have manifeſted thy Name unto the Men which thou gaveſt me out of the World, thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy Word, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.6, 12, 15, 24.</p>
            <p>They are peculiarly guarded, and kept by Chriſt, that they may not be loſt, but are preſerved againſt all evil, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91. all, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 54.10. they are protected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Poyſonous or hurtful Weapons, no Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon framed againſt thee ſhall proſper, and every Tongue which ſhall riſe againſt thee in Judgment, ſhalt thou Condemn, this is the Heritage of the Lord, and their Righteouſneſs is of me, ſaith the Lord; <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49.2, 16.</p>
            <p>They are in Chriſts own keeping, ſo that they are graven on the Palms of his Hands, and are Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved to the enjoyment of God, and to be ſet on his Throne, and <hi>When he maketh up his Jewels, they are ſpared,</hi> Rev. 3.24. Mal. 3.17.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This one thing more is peculiar to Chriſts Army, whereas in other Armies the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome are preſſed, others hired, of divers Nations, Languages, Judgments, Intereſts, and Perſwaſions, all Chriſts are Volunteers.</p>
            <p>Thy People ſhall be a willing People in the Day of thy Power, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. They are all of one Spirit with Chriſt, he puts his Spirit within them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39.</p>
            <p>They are all united to Chriſt, and are of one mind,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65284:157"/> and Will with him, <hi>one in us, as we are one,</hi> John 17.21.</p>
            <p>They are all of one mind, and unanimous amongſt themſelves, with a Heavenly Harmony, and their Sentiments is one amongſt themſelves, <hi>Like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Oyntment on the Head, which ran down upon the Beard, and as the Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and the Dew on the Mount of</hi> Zion, Pſ. 133.</p>
            <p>As they all accord in Sentiments, they are guilty neither of Murmuring, Rebellion, or Mutiny, but Holy and Peaceable, therefore all their deſires are acceptable with God, and are written and recorded by him in his Book of Life, and they that feared Lord, ſpoke often one to another, and a Book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and thought often upon his Name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>Then to conclude, if it be of a Truth, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhall have Eternal Life, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3 16.</p>
            <p>Are they under an everlaſting Covenant with God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19, 20, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 59.20, 21. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 60.20, 21. <hi>Ro.</hi> 11.27, 29.</p>
            <p>Do Remiſſion of Sins, of whatſoever degree or quality belong to them, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43.26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>Shall they have Comfort in Darkneſs? <hi>Iſ.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Mal</hi> 3 16.</p>
            <p>Shall they be Heirs of all things? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 14.</p>
            <p>Shall they be one with God in Chriſt Jeſus, in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Spirit and Glory, <hi>Jo.</hi> 17.21, <hi>to</hi> 25</p>
            <p>Shall nothing preſent, or to come ſeparate them from him, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.35, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>Shall they ſit on the Throne of God with Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</p>
            <p>Shall Chriſt have Univerſal Sympathy with them in all their Afflictions, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 63.9.</p>
            <pb n="290" facs="tcp:65284:158"/>

            <p>Shall their Chaſtiſement from God be in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Iſ.</hi> 27.7, 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20.</p>

            <pb n="293" facs="tcp:65284:159"/>
            <p>And further, Let us draw near with a true Heart, and full Aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from an evil Conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure Water, let us hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith, without wavering, for he is faithful, who hath promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Let us imitate that Holy Apoſtle, I have fought the good fight of Faith, I have finiſhed my Courſe, henceforth for me is laid up a Crown of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which the Righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not only to me, but to all them alſo that love his appearing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.8.</p>
            <p>What can or ſhould hinder the Joy and rejoycing of the People of God, who are ſo well ſecured and aſſured of their everlaſting Intereſt in him? There is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. If God be for us who can be againſt us? Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that Juſtifieth who ſhall condemn? Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, and maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 31, to 35.</p>
            <p>Are there, or can there be greater cauſes of Joy, and Satisfaction, than in the aſſurance of Eternal happineſs given in Scriptures to Believers, no caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of condition in life or death, can ſeparate them from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. to 15, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, to 40.</p>
            <p>And whatever troubles or afflictions ſhall attend them in this World, though their days may be ſpent in ſorrow, labour, and tragical afflictions, their end ſhall be joyous and comical; He that ſoweth in Tears ſhall reap in Joy, he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing pretious Seed, ſhall doubtleſs come again with rejoycing, bringing his Sheaves with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:65284:160"/>
            <p>The condition of the Godly in the end ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be happy; Though you have lyen among the Pots yet ſhall ye be like the Wings of a Dove, whoſe Feathers are covered with Silver, and her Wings with yellow Gold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.13.</p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude all, let us imitate the Holy Apoſtle; Be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know that your work is not in vain in the Lord, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 58. In all theſe things we are more than Conquerours, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.35. to end, and let us in thankſgiving acknowledge the Soveraign excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſts love with <hi>Pſalms</hi> 148. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 150.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>Now unto him by whom the World was created and ſubſiſts, who bounds the Seas, who reveals to man his Thoughts, who doth in the Armies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth what he pleaſeth, and none dares ſay to him, what doſt thou? <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.47.

Who leads his people to the living Fountains of Water and wipes away all Tears from their Eyes, and Crowns them with everlaſting glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.16, 17.</p>
            <p>Who is the way, truth, life, light and reſurrection, <hi>John.</hi> 14.6.
